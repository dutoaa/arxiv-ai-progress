  "key_insight": "Introduce a trainable adversarial parametric editing mechanism that actively adjusts VLM behavior to reduce hallucinations by strengthening visual grounding and weakening misleading linguistic priors.",
  "problem_solved": "VLMs frequently produce hallucinated text that is inconsistent with the input image because they over-rely on language priors and insufficiently integrate visual features; this paper targets systematic mitigation of those hallucinations with a trainable, model-editing approach.",
  "method": [
    "Parametric editing module: inject a small, learnable edit into the VLM (weights or adapter-like module) that can be optimized without retraining the whole model.",
    "Adversarial training: generate adversarial queries or perturbations that expose hallucination tendencies and optimize the edit to reduce incorrect, non-visual predictions.",
    "Evaluation & calibration: measure hallucination rates before/after the edit using visual-grounding benchmarks and preserve general language/vision performance while reducing hallucinations."

  "impact": "Provides a practical, trainable way to reduce visual hallucinations in deployed VLMs, improving reliability and safety for vision-language applications without full model retraining.",
