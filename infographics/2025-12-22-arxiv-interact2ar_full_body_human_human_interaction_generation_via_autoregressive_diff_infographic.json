  "key_insight": "An autoregressive diffusion framework that generates full-body, multi-person interactions step-by-step, preserving realistic hand motions and dynamic coordination between interactants.",
  "problem_solved": "Bridges the gap in interaction synthesis by modeling both detailed hand motion and inter-person coordination simultaneously, overcoming data and complexity limitations that caused prior methods to ignore hands or generate entire sequences at once.",
  "method": [
    "Autoregressive diffusion: generate motion in temporal chunks (or tokens) sequentially to improve temporal coherence and capture fine-grained dynamics.",
    "Joint multi-agent modeling: represent multiple interactants together so the model learns coordination cues (body pose + hands) rather than independent motions.",
    "Hierarchical/detail-aware decoding: separate or conditioned modules for coarse body motion and fine hand articulation to retain expressivity while controlling complexity."

  "impact": "Enables more realistic, expressive multi-person motion synthesis for animation, VR/AR, robotics and human-centric simulation, giving practitioners a scalable way to model interactions with detailed hands and tighter temporal coordination.",
