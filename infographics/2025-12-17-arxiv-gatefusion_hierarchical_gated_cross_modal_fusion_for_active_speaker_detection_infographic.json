  "problem_solved": "Late fusion of audio and visual features misses fine-grained cross-modal cues needed to robustly identify who is speaking in unconstrained video; GateFusion addresses this by learning gated, hierarchical interactions between modalities.",

    "Start with strong pretrained unimodal encoders for audio and visual streams to extract rich features.",
    "Use a Hierarchical Gated Fusion Decoder (HiGat) that applies gated attention/interaction at multiple temporal and spatial scales to fuse modalities progressively.",
    "Train the fusion decoder (lightweight, plug-and-play) to produce frame-level active speaker predictions, enabling fine-grained cross-modal alignment and noise-robust decisions."

  "impact": "Provides a practical, modular fusion strategy that improves robustness and interpretability for multimodal ASD systems and can be dropped into existing pipelines that use pretrained encoders.",
