  "key_insight": "FrontierCS introduces a 156-problem benchmark of open-ended computer science challenges where optimal solutions are unknown but solution quality can be objectively measured, shifting evaluation from label prediction to producing and executing programs.",
  "problem_solved": "Existing benchmarks emphasize tasks with known optimal answers and static metrics; FrontierCS addresses the need for evaluating model creativity, algorithmic reasoning, and real-world coding ability on open-ended CS problems.",
  "method": [
    "Curate 156 diverse, open-ended CS problems spanning algorithms, systems, theory, and applied areas, designed and reviewed by CS PhDs, top competitive programmers, and problem setters.",
    "Require models to produce executable programs as solutions rather than scalar predictions, enabling objective, automated evaluation via program execution and measurable outputs.",
    "Provide a standardized benchmark framework that captures solution quality (e.g., correctness, efficiency, robustness) even when a single optimal solution is unknown."
