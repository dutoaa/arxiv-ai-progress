  ],
  "impact": "Provides AI/ML practitioners a practical approach to build affinity predictors that are both more accurate and better-calibrated for deployment—improving hit selection and reducing risk in drug discovery workflows. The framework is a useful template for OOD-aware multimodal prediction in other domains.",
