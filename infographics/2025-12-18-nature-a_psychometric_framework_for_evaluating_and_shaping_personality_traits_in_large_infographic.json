    "Adapt established psychometric personality assessments (e.g., questionnaire-style prompts) to elicit and score LLM responses.",
    "Validate reliability and consistency of measurements across large, instruction-tuned models.",
    "Demonstrate controllability by conditioning or fine-tuning models to reproduce target personality profiles and testing transfer to downstream tasks."
