  "key_insight": "Semantic encoders concentrate information in low-frequency components (abstract meaning) while pixel encoders preserve additional high-frequency components (fine detail); the Prism Hypothesis shows these spectral roles can be harmonized via a unified autoencoding objective to yield representations that serve both semantics and pixels.",
  "problem_solved": "Bridges the gap between semantic and pixel representations by diagnosing why they differ (spectral composition) and proposing a unified autoencoding strategy to retain both abstract semantics and high-frequency image detail in a single representation.",
