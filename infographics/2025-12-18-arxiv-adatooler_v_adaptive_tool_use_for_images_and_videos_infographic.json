    "Learned gating/policy module that predicts, per query, whether a vision tool (image/video) is necessary before invoking expensive visual processing.",
    "Integration with multimodal interleaved chain-of-thought and vision tool interactions so the model can either answer directly or call tools and continue reasoning when needed.",
    "Cost-aware training objective and evaluation to balance accuracy vs. number of tool calls, demonstrating lower latency and resource use with equal or better accuracy on image/video tasks."
