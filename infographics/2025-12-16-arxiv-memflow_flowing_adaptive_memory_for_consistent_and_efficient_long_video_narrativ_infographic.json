    "Adaptive memory retrieval: for each new chunk, selectively fetches historical cues most relevant to the generation target instead of using uniformly compressed history.",
    "Flowing memory update: continuously propagates and updates compact memory representations across time so past references remain aligned and consistent with future frames.",
    "Efficiency-focused compression & retrieval: compresses only salient information and uses fast lookup/update to scale to long contexts with reduced compute/memory costs."

  "impact": "Makes long-video generation more coherent and scalable—practitioners can generate longer, consistent narratives with lower resource consumption and improved temporal fidelity. Useful for streaming generation, video editing, and story-continuity applications.",
