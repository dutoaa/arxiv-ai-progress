  "key_insight": "Injecting ophthalmology knowledge into a multimodal transformer creates a joint embedding space that aligns retinal fundus images with clinical text and metadata far better than general-domain CLIP models, improving cross-modal retrieval and diagnostic interpretability.",
  "problem_solved": "General vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) underperform on medical images and fail to capture fine-grained, domain-specific relations needed for accurate cross-modal retrieval and diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. The paper addresses poor alignment between ophthalmic images and clinical text/metadata and the need for clinically relevant multimodal representations.",
  "method": [
    "Knowledge-enhanced joint embedding: fuse retinal fundus images, clinical text, and structured patient metadata into a unified representation using domain priors (e.g., ophthalmology ontology/lesion labels).",
    "Multimodal transformer backbone: cross-attention layers and modality-specific encoders trained with contrastive and retrieval-aware losses to tighten cross-modal alignment.",
    "Fine-tuning and evaluation on DR datasets with attention/interpretability modules (e.g., lesion-level attention maps) to validate improved retrieval, diagnosis support, and clinical relevance."

  "impact": "Provides a practical path to adapt vision-language models for clinical use, improving cross-modal retrieval, diagnostic support, and interpretability in diabetic retinopathy — enabling more reliable AI tools for ophthalmology and faster integration into clinical workflows.",
