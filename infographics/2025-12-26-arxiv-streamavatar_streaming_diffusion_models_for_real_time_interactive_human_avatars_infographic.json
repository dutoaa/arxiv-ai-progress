  "key_insight": "A causal, two-stage streaming diffusion architecture enables real-time, low-latency generation of interactive human avatars and extends diffusion-based avatars from head-and-shoulder to full-body gestures.",
  "problem_solved": "Diffusion-based avatar generators are non-causal and computationally heavy, making them unsuitable for live streaming and interactive control; existing interactive systems are often limited to head-and-shoulder outputs and cannot produce responsive full-body motion.",

    "Two-stage streaming diffusion pipeline: first stage produces low-latency coarse-frame/pose predictions, second stage refines details progressively while maintaining causality.",
    "Causal conditioning and temporal streaming design to process incoming control signals (e.g., audio, motion) frame-by-frame with bounded latency.",
    "System-level optimizations for efficiency (lightweight denoisers, progressive refinement, and streaming-friendly scheduling) to enable real-time interaction and full-body synthesis."

  "impact": "Enables practical deployment of diffusion-powered avatars for live interactive applications (virtual hosts, telepresence, game NPCs) by reducing latency and expanding controllable motion beyond head-and-shoulder, making advanced generative models usable in real-time pipelines.",
