  "key_insight": "Streamo is a real-time streaming video LLM that generalizes beyond QA/captioning to perform a wide spectrum of time-sensitive video tasks (narration, action understanding, event captioning, temporal grounding, and time-aware QA) by instruction-tuning on a large streaming-focused dataset.",
  "problem_solved": "Bridges the gap between narrow online video models and a general-purpose interactive streaming video assistant that can understand and respond to continuous, time-sensitive video inputs in real time.",
  "method": [
    "Design a streaming-aware multimodal LLM pipeline that ingests continuous video frames and produces timely, context-aware natural language outputs.",
    "Instruction-tune the model on a large, purpose-built dataset (Streamo-Instruct-465K) covering diverse streaming tasks and temporal supervision to teach task-flexible, time-sensitive behavior.",
    "Unify multiple temporal tasks (narration, event captioning, temporal grounding, time-sensitive QA) under a single instruction-following framework to enable one model to handle varied real-time video interactions."
  ],
  "impact": "Enables practitioners to build interactive, real-time video assistants that handle a range of temporal understanding tasks with one model, reducing the need for separate task-specific systems and improving usability in live applications (e.g., surveillance, live sports commentary, assistive tech).",
