  "key_insight": "WorldCanvas enables promptable, user-directed event simulation by jointly conditioning on natural language, motion trajectories (timing, visibility), and reference images, producing coherent and controllable visual events that go beyond text-only or trajectory-only methods.",
  "problem_solved": "Existing image-to-video and text-only generation systems struggle to simultaneously control motion, timing, object identity, and semantic intent; WorldCanvas addresses the gap by fusing trajectories, reference visuals, and language for precise, grounded event synthesis.",
  "method": [
    "Multimodal conditioning: combine natural language for intent, explicit trajectories for motion/timing/visibility, and reference images for visual identity.",
    "Trajectory encoding: represent motion and temporal visibility as structured controls that guide event progression.",
    "Generative conditioning pipeline: feed the fused multimodal representation into a video/image generation model to produce coherent, controllable event sequences."
  ],
  "impact": "This approach gives practitioners fine-grained, intuitive control over generated events—useful for simulation, content creation, and data augmentation—by making motion, timing, and visual identity directly promptable.",
