  "key_insight": "ReaSeq enriches ID-based sequential recommenders by injecting world knowledge and explicit reasoning into item/user representations, enabling models to infer beyond-log interests and remain robust under sparse interaction data.",
  "problem_solved": "Overcomes knowledge poverty in ID-only item embeddings and the closed-loop blindness of log-driven recommenders by leveraging external semantic/world knowledge and reasoning to capture latent user interests beyond platform logs.",
  "method": [
    "Map item IDs to rich semantic representations using external sources (e.g., knowledge graphs or pretrained language models) to recover product/world knowledge.",
    "Apply a lightweight reasoning module (chain-of-thought / inference over facts) to derive latent user intents and beyond-log interests from enriched item semantics.",
    "Fuse the reasoned semantic signals with sequential modeling (e.g., session/trajectory encoder) so downstream ranking or next-item prediction uses both interaction patterns and world knowledge."
  ],
  "impact": "Makes sequential recommenders more data-efficient and generalizable—better cold-start performance, fewer brittle predictions under sparse logs, and the ability to recommend items aligned with users' off-platform interests.",
