  "key_insight": "The paper shows that using large language models in scholarly writing creates a provenance problem: authorship, source attribution, and the chain of inputs/edits become hard to trace, undermining transparency and accountability.",
  "problem_solved": "Identifies and clarifies the challenge that LLM-assisted writing breaks or obscures provenance signals needed for reproducibility, proper attribution, and editorial/ethical oversight in academic publishing.",
  "method": [
    "Map common scholarly writing workflows to pinpoint where provenance is lost (prompts, model versions, post‑edits, source retrieval).",
    "Categorize types of missing provenance (source attribution, prompt history, model/config details, training-data linkage) and their practical consequences.",
    "Propose interventions (metadata/standardization, tool-level provenance capture, and editorial policy recommendations) to restore traceability."
  ],
  "impact": "For AI/ML practitioners, addressing provenance is essential to preserve reproducibility, assess model influence on results, and maintain research integrity—adopting provenance practices reduces risk and increases trust in published work.",
