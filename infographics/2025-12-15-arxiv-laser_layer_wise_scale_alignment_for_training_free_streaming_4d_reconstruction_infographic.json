  "key_insight": "LASER is a training-free conversion framework that enables high-quality feed‑forward 4D reconstruction models to run in streaming (causal) mode by aligning layer-wise feature scales, removing the quadratic memory bottleneck without retraining.",
  "problem_solved": "Offline feed-forward reconstructions (e.g., VGGT, π3) cannot handle streaming video due to quadratic memory growth and require costly retraining for causal variants; LASER lets practitioners deploy these strong offline models on streaming inputs efficiently while preserving geometric priors.",
  "method": [
    "Layer-wise scale alignment: match and rescale intermediate multi-scale feature statistics so features remain stable across temporal chunks for causal processing.",
    "Training-free conversion: wrap existing feed‑forward reconstruction networks with the alignment mechanism and lightweight buffering to produce streaming outputs without modifying model weights.",
    "Memory-efficient streaming: replace quadratic global attention/memory with aligned, local causal propagation to achieve linear (or near-constant) memory while maintaining reconstruction fidelity."
  ],
  "impact": "Practitioners can convert state-of-the-art offline 4D reconstruction models into real-time, streaming systems without retraining—reducing memory and compute costs while keeping high geometric accuracy, enabling deployment on resource‑constrained or latency‑sensitive applications.",
