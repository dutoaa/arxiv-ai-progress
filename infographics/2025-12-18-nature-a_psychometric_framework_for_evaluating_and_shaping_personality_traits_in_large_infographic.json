  "method": [
    "Adapt standardized psychometric instruments to prompt and query LLMs to elicit trait-relevant responses.",
    "Evaluate reliability and validity of resulting measurements across large instruction-tuned models.",
    "Demonstrate that specific personality profiles can be induced or mimicked to influence downstream task behavior."
