  "key_insight": "StereoPilot replaces the fragile multi-stage Depth–Warp–Inpaint pipeline with a single, unified model that leverages generative priors to produce high-quality stereo views from monocular video, handling occlusions and format conversions more robustly and efficiently.",
  "problem_solved": "Addresses error propagation, depth ambiguity, occlusion filling failures, and format inconsistency (parallel vs converged stereo) in automatic monocular-to-stereo conversion.",
  "method": [
    "Train a unified converter that conditions on a monocular frame plus geometry cues and uses generative priors to synthesize the complementary view in one stage, avoiding sequential D→W→I errors.",
    "Incorporate geometry-aware modules (disparity/epipolar constraints) and a format adapter to support both parallel and converged stereo layouts.",
    "Leverage generative priors for realistic appearance, robust occlusion hallucination, and compact/efficient inference compared to multi-step pipelines."

  "impact": "Simplifies and stabilizes monocular-to-stereo conversion, making high-quality stereo content generation more accessible for VR/3D production and enabling practitioners to integrate stereo synthesis into real-time or resource-constrained pipelines.",
