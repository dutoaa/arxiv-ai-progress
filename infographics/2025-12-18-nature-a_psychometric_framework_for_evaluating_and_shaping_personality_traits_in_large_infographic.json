  "key_insight": "Standardized psychometric tests can reliably measure personality-like traits in instruction-tuned LLMs, and those trait profiles can be validated and deliberately reproduced to influence downstream behavior.",

  "method": [
    "Adapt established psychometric instruments (e.g., Big Five-style items) into model prompts and score model responses as trait measures.",
    "Establish reliability and validity via statistical tests (internal consistency, test–retest, convergent/discriminant validation) across model families and settings.",
    "Shape or mimic target personality profiles using conditioning or prompt/fine-tuning interventions and evaluate effects on downstream tasks."
