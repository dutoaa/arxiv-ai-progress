  "key_insight": "Yume-1.5 delivers text-guided, interactive world generation by combining a compact diffusion backbone, efficient sampling, and a history-aware state representation — enabling realistic, explorable worlds with far lower latency and parameter cost than prior methods.",
  "problem_solved": "Existing diffusion-based interactive world generators are too large, slow (many inference steps), and accumulate growing historical context, and most lack precise text-conditioned control. Yume-1.5 tackles these bottlenecks to enable real-time, text-controlled generation and interaction.",
