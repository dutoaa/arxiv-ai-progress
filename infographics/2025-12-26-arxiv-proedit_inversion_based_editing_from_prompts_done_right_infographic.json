  "key_insight": "ProEdit identifies that over-reliance on injecting source-image information during inversion-based sampling prevents faithful target edits; by controlling how and when source priors are injected and by modulating attention with prompt guidance, it preserves consistency while enabling stronger, correct edits.",
  "problem_solved": "Existing inversion-based prompt editing methods maintain consistency by heavily reintroducing source information during sampling, which inadvertently blocks intended changes (pose, count, color, etc.) in the edited output. ProEdit solves the trade-off between preserving source identity and allowing prompt-driven edits.",
  "method": [
    "Prompt-aligned inversion: compute an inversion that separates editable semantic content from fixed source attributes, enabling prompt-conditioned manipulation without retraining.",
    "Adaptive source-injection schedule: reduce or modulate the amount and timing of source information reintroduced during sampling to avoid overpowering the target edit.",
    "Attention- and guidance-modulation: selectively reweight cross-attention and classifier-free guidance according to prompt signals so edits take effect where intended while preserving unrelated source details."
  ],
  "impact": "ProEdit enables reliable, training-free image/video editing from text prompts that both preserves source fidelity and implements stronger, correct edits—useful for content creators, prompt engineers, and researchers working with diffusion-based editing pipelines.",
