  "key_insight": "FrontierCS is a curated benchmark of 156 open-ended computer‑science problems that require models to produce executable solutions which can be objectively evaluated even when the optimal answer is unknown. It shifts evaluation from closed-form tasks to real-world programmatic problem solving vetted by CS experts.",
  "problem_solved": "Existing benchmarks emphasize problems with known optimal solutions or fixed-answer formats, leaving a gap in assessing models' open-ended algorithmic creativity, program synthesis, and performance trade-offs; FrontierCS fills this gap with expert-designed, executable challenges.",
  "method": [
    "Curate 156 diverse, open-ended CS problems designed and reviewed by CS PhDs, competitive programmers, and problem setters.",
    "Require models to produce executable programs; evaluate submissions automatically using objective criteria (correctness, resource usage, performance) and supplement with expert review for quality.",
    "Organize problems across topics and difficulty to enable comparative benchmarking of algorithmic reasoning, coding ability, and generalization."
  ],
  "impact": "FrontierCS enables robust evaluation of models' real-world coding and algorithmic reasoning beyond fixed-answer benchmarks, guiding development of more capable program-synthesis and reasoning systems for research and deployment.",
