    "Assembled PoseBench: a curated, diverse dataset of protein–ligand complexes with standardized evaluation metrics (e.g., RMSD-based success rates).",
    "Systematically evaluated representative deep-learning docking and structure-prediction models under consistent protocols to compare accuracy, confidence calibration, and robustness.",
    "Performed diagnostic analyses of failure modes and generalization (by target family and ligand chemistry) to identify specific gaps and limitations."
