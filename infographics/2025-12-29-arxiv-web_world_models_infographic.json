  "key_insight": "Web World Model (WWM) encodes persistent world state and physics as ordinary web code, providing a middle ground that is more controllable and engineering-friendly than fully generative worlds while more flexible than fixed database-backed web apps.",
  "problem_solved": "Bridges the gap between rigid, reliable web frameworks and unlimited but hard-to-control generative world models, enabling language agents to act, remember, and learn in persistent, debuggable, and configurable environments.",
  "method": [
    "Implement world state and dynamics using standard web technologies (HTML/CSS/JavaScript and backend services) so environments are inspectable and programmable.",
    "Expose interactions through web APIs, DOM events, and conventional web interfaces so language agents can perceive and act using familiar web paradigms.",
    "Combine deterministic engineering primitives (persistence, transactional updates, logging) with configurable generative components to support variability, learning, and reproducible experiments."
  ],
  "impact": "WWM makes it practical to build agent environments that are persistent, observable, and reproducible, reducing engineering friction and improving controllability for research and deployed language-agent systems.",
