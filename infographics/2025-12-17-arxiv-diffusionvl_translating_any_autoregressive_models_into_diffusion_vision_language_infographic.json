  "key_insight": "DiffusionVL provides a practical recipe to convert any powerful autoregressive (AR) model into a competitive diffusion-based vision–language model, unlocking diffusion decoding benefits while retaining AR capabilities.",
  "problem_solved": "Diffusion vision–language models (dVLMs) underperform compared to mainstream AR-based VLMs because base diffusion language models lack capacity; the paper solves how to leverage existing strong AR models to build high-performing dVLMs.",
  "method": [
    "Introduce a translation mechanism (adapters/distillation) that maps pretrained AR model outputs into diffusion model denoising/score functions, enabling reuse of AR knowledge without training a large diffusion LM from scratch.",
    "Align latent/text-conditioned representations between AR and diffusion domains via targeted distillation and lightweight adapter modules so the diffusion sampler can follow AR guidance during generation.",
    "Train the translated dVLM with image-conditioned diffusion sampling and AR-derived supervision to preserve generation quality while gaining diffusion advantages (parallelism, diversity, controllable decoding)."
  ],
  "impact": "Enables practitioners to convert existing AR models into diffusion VLMs quickly, combining AR performance with diffusion benefits (faster parallel sampling, richer diversity, and new controllability). This lowers development cost and accelerates adoption of diffusion paradigms in multimodal systems.",
