    "Design a modular teleoperation interface that decomposes humanoid control into submodules (hand-eye coordination, grasp primitives, arm end-effector tracking, locomotion).",
    "Train a scalable learning framework that learns submodule policies from teleoperation data and uses a higher-level choice policy to select and coordinate submodules.",
    "Integrate teleoperation, learned primitives, and the choice policy to enable seamless whole-body coordination during manipulation and locomotion tasks."
