  "problem_solved": "Existing screens struggle to capture subtle, network-level functional effects of genetic perturbations in neuronal dynamics and require extensive labeled data or hand-crafted features.",
  "method": [
    "Incorporate network structure (functional/structural connectivity) into representation learning so dynamics are learned in a network-aware latent space.",
    "Use self-supervised objectives (e.g., temporal contrastive/predictive tasks) on raw activity time series to learn rich phenotypic embeddings without labels.",
    "Deploy a high-throughput pipeline that maps genetic perturbations to learned embeddings, then ranks/modulates candidate genetic modifiers by phenotypic shift."
