    "Augment neural diagnostic models to output calibrated uncertainty alongside predictions so low-confidence cases are identified.",
    "Implement on-device mechanisms for out-of-distribution detection and decision triggers (e.g., repeat test, escalate to human review) when uncertainty is high.",
    "Use lightweight calibration and UQ techniques suitable for edge deployment to preserve low latency and resource constraints."
