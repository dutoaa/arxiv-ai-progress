  "key_insight": "DiffusionVL provides a model‑agnostic way to translate pretrained autoregressive (AR) models into diffusion-based vision–language models, combining AR capability with diffusion decoding advantages to close the performance gap between paradigms.",
  "problem_solved": "Diffusion VLMs lag behind mainstream AR-based multimodal models because base diffusion language models lack capability; this work enables reuse of powerful AR models so diffusion VLMs can achieve competitive performance without training large diffusion LMs from scratch.",
  "method": [
    "Model‑agnostic conversion: introduce a translator/adapter layer to map pretrained AR model representations into a diffusion VLM latent/conditioning space so existing AR weights can be reused.",
    "Parameter‑efficient alignment: use lightweight adapters and targeted fine‑tuning instead of full retraining to preserve AR capabilities while enabling diffusion decoding.",
    "Cross‑paradigm training: align behaviors via denoising objectives and cross‑model distillation so the converted diffusion VLM matches AR model quality while gaining diffusion advantages."
  ],
  "impact": "Practitioners can rapidly deploy diffusion VLMs that inherit the strengths of mature AR models, lowering compute and data costs for building high‑quality multimodal generators and unlocking diffusion benefits (e.g., diverse and flexible decoding) in production.",
