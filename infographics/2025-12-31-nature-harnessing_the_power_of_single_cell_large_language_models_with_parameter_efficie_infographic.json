  "key_insight": "A small, parameter-efficient fine-tuning layer (scPEFT) added to pretrained single-cell language models enables strong generalization to unseen diseases, treatments and cell types without full model re-training. It achieves better cross-condition performance while keeping compute and storage costs low.",
  "problem_solved": "Full fine-tuning of large single-cell models is computationally expensive and often fails to generalize to novel biological conditions (new diseases, treatments, or rare cell types); scPEFT addresses efficient adaptation and improved out-of-distribution performance.",
  "method": [
    "Attach a lightweight, parameter-efficient fine-tuning module to a pretrained single-cell language model so base weights remain frozen or minimally changed.",
    "Train only the added parameters on task-specific single-cell data (e.g., perturbations, disease labels), enabling rapid adaptation with far fewer trainable weights.",
    "Evaluate transfer to unseen diseases/treatments/cell types to demonstrate improved accuracy and reduced compute/storage compared with full fine-tuning."

  "impact": "scPEFT lowers the barrier to apply large single-cell models in new biological contexts by cutting compute and storage needs while improving robustness to out-of-distribution conditions — useful for researchers and engineers deploying models across labs and datasets.",
