    "Learned adaptive gating: a lightweight decision module predicts whether a visual reasoning step requires external vision-tool invocation based on input context and model confidence.",
    "Interleaved multimodal CoT with selective tool invocation: integrates chain-of-thought reasoning that calls vision tools only when the gate signals necessity, plus a lightweight verifier to avoid missed calls.",
    "Cost-aware training/objective: balances accuracy and inference cost (tool-call penalty) so the model learns the accuracy/latency tradeoff for images and videos."

  "impact": "Enables more efficient, scalable deployment of multimodal LLMs for image and video understanding by cutting unnecessary tool calls and improving throughput without sacrificing (and often improving) accuracy.",
