  "key_insight": "Representation encoders can be made suitable latents for text-to-image diffusion if they are trained to preserve both semantic structure and pixel-level reconstructability — enforcing compactness and reconstruction together yields robust generative and editing performance.",
  "problem_solved": "Bridges the gap between discriminative high‑dimensional features (good for understanding) and the low‑level VAE latents (good for generation), solving instability and poor reconstruction when using representation features as diffusion latents.",
  "method": [
    "Introduce dual objectives for encoder outputs: a compactness/regularization term to make the feature space diffusion-friendly, plus a reconstruction loss (or lightweight decoder) to ensure pixel recoverability.",
    "Adapt the diffusion training to operate on the regularized representation space and/or learn a small adapter/mapper between representation features and generative latents, preserving semantic fidelity for editing and conditioning.",
    "Empirically validate with text-to-image generation and editing tasks, showing improved realism, semantic alignment, and controllable edits compared to using raw discriminative features."
