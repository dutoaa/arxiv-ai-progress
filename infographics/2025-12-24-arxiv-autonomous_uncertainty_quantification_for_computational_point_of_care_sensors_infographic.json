  "key_insight": "An autonomous uncertainty-quantification (UQ) layer for computational point-of-care sensors can detect when neural-network diagnoses are unreliable and trigger safe downstream actions, reducing the risk of silent misdiagnosis while remaining lightweight enough for POC deployment.",
  "problem_solved": "Neural-network based POC diagnostic models can hallucinate or produce overconfident but incorrect predictions; this paper addresses the lack of on-device, automated uncertainty estimation and decision rules that flag unreliable outputs in resource-limited, real-world settings.",
  "method": [
    "Integrate a lightweight, on-device UQ module that produces calibrated predictive uncertainties alongside model outputs (e.g., calibration + approximate Bayesian/ensemble methods optimized for edge compute).",
    "Combine uncertainty scores with out-of-distribution detection and task-specific thresholds to autonomously trigger fail-safe actions (human review, repeat test, or safe 'inconclusive' label).",
    "Validate and tune the pipeline under realistic POC noise, sensor variability, and compute/memory constraints to ensure reliability and feasibility for field deployment."

  "impact": "Provides a practical route to safer, more trustworthy AI-driven diagnostics at the point of care by enabling models to know and communicate their limits; useful for practitioners building calibrated, deployable ML systems under tight resource constraints.",
