  "key_insight": "AnyAD presents a single unified anomaly-detection model that works with any subset of multi-sequence brain MRI — it handles missing modalities at inference without retraining while maintaining robust anomaly detection.",
  "problem_solved": "Overcomes clinical challenges of scarce annotated abnormalities and frequently absent MRI sequences by avoiding fixed-modality pipelines and eliminating the need to train separate models for every modality combination.",
  "method": [
    "Learn modality-agnostic representations and a shared anomaly scoring mechanism so the same model can ingest any available subset of MRI sequences.",
    "Train with simulated missing-modality conditions (e.g., modality dropout / cross-modal consistency) and reconstruction/consistency objectives to enable prediction from incomplete inputs.",
    "Unified inference: compute anomaly scores/maps directly from whatever sequences are present, without modality-specific retraining or ensemble models."
  ],
  "impact": "Makes anomaly detection in multi-sequence MRI practical for real clinical settings with variable imaging protocols, improving deployability and reducing annotation/training burden for AI practitioners working on medical imaging.",
