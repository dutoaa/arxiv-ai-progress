  "key_insight": "WWM puts persistent, controllable world state and \"physics\" into ordinary web code, creating an intermediate paradigm between fixed web frameworks and fully generative world models that balances realism, engineering practicality, and agent freedom.",
  "problem_solved": "Bridges the gap between rigid, database-backed web contexts and unconstrained generative environments by providing persistent, debuggable, and programmable worlds that language agents can reliably act in, remember from, and learn within.",
  "method": [
    "Encode world state and interaction rules as standard web artifacts (HTML/CSS/JavaScript, DOM, server endpoints) so environments are hostable, observable, and modifiable with existing web tooling.",
    "Expose deterministic APIs and event hooks for agents to perceive, act, and receive feedback while allowing optional generative components for richer content where needed.",
    "Leverage web infrastructure for persistence, debugging, and deployment—enabling reproducible scenarios, modular composition of sub-worlds, and integration with agent frameworks."
