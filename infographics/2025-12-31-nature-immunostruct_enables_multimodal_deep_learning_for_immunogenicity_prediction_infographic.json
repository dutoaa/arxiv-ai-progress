  "key_insight": "ImmunoStruct integrates sequence, 3D structure, and biochemical properties into a single multimodal deep-learning model to predict immunogenicity. The model produces interpretable attributions that help generate mechanistic hypotheses about why molecules trigger immune responses.",
  "problem_solved": "Predicting immunogenicity requires combining diverse molecular information (primary sequence, tertiary structure and physicochemical features) and providing interpretable explanations — a gap that prevents reliable screening and hypothesis-driven design in therapeutics and vaccines.",
  "method": [
    "Separate encoders extract representations from amino-acid sequence, 3D structural embeddings, and computed biochemical features.",
    "A multimodal fusion module integrates these representations and feeds them to a prediction head that outputs immunogenicity scores.",
    "An interpretability layer (e.g., attention/attribution maps) links predictions back to specific residues, structural motifs, or physicochemical signals to support hypothesis generation."
  ],
  "impact": "For ML practitioners this demonstrates how multimodal architectures can improve biological prediction tasks while preserving interpretability, enabling more informed molecule prioritization and targeted experimental follow-up.",
