    "Train a deep generative model to map desired optical/electromagnetic responses to intermediate surface-current maps (a physically meaningful representation).",
    "Use a secondary translator or constrained optimization to convert predicted surface-current maps into manufacturable layout geometries for single and stacked/tunable metasurfaces.",
    "Condition or regularize the models with physics constraints (e.g., Maxwell-consistent priors or simulated forward checks) to improve stability and generalization."

  "impact": "This approach makes inverse-design workflows more robust, interpretable, and faster to converge; ML practitioners can adopt intermediate physical states to improve stability and impose domain knowledge in other physics-based inverse problems.",
