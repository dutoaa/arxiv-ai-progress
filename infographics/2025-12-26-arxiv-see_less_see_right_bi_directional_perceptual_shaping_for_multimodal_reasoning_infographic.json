  "key_insight": "BiPS converts question-conditioned masked views into bidirectional \"where-to-look\" signals that steer a VLM toward the small, task-relevant visual evidence (and away from distractors), improving fine-grained multimodal reasoning while cutting inference cost.",
  "problem_solved": "Existing VLM intermediate cues miss fine-grained visual features (e.g., polylines in charts), generalize poorly across domains, and are inference-time expensive; BiPS addresses accurate, efficient, and generalizable visual guidance for reasoning.",
  "method": [
    "Generate question-conditioned masked views that reveal candidate visual evidence while suppressing irrelevant regions.",
    "Produce bidirectional perceptual signals (positive \"look-here\" maps and negative \"ignore-this\" maps) to shape model attention both ways during reasoning.",
    "Inject these lightweight signals as priors (e.g., attention masks or latent tokens) into the VLM pipeline to improve fine-grained evidence capture and reduce token/computation overhead."

  "impact": "Enables more accurate, interpretable, and compute-efficient multimodal reasoning—particularly for tasks requiring fine visual detail (charts, diagrams)—and improves cross-domain robustness for practitioners deploying VLMs under resource constraints.",
