  "key_insight": "TICON uses a transformer to contextualize tile embeddings at the whole-slide level, producing rich, slide-aware representations that improve local and global histopathology tasks. It is designed to plug into any existing tile-encoder pipeline to add context without retraining the encoder.",
  "problem_solved": "Standard pipelines treat tiles as independent patches, losing critical slide-level context needed for accurate interpretation of local features and for downstream slide-level tasks.",
  "method": [
    "Take precomputed tile embeddings from any tile encoder and feed them into a transformer-based contextualizer operating at the slide level.",
    "Model inter-tile relationships and spatial/slide context so each tile embedding becomes slide-aware while remaining compatible with downstream models.",
    "Produce contextualized tile embeddings that can be used for local tasks (e.g., patch classification, segmentation) and global tasks (e.g., slide classification, prognosis) without modifying the original encoder."
  ],
  "impact": "TICON enables plug-and-play contextual representation learning for whole-slide images, improving task performance and generalization in computational pathology while preserving existing encoder investments.",
