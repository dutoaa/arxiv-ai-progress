  "key_insight": "Closing the information gap between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-limited student observations — by intentionally reducing expert advantages (visibility/uncertainty) or making demonstrations learner-aware — substantially improves closed-loop imitation driving performance in simulation.",
  "problem_solved": "Imitation-learned end-to-end driving policies trained on privileged expert data fail in closed-loop because experts have higher visibility and lower uncertainty than the sensor-based learners; this paper addresses that learner–expert asymmetry.",
  "method": [
    "Quantify the asymmetry between privileged expert state (full visibility, low uncertainty) and student sensor observations.",
    "Reduce expert advantages via interventions (e.g., masking privileged info, adding occlusions/noise, or generating learner-aware expert targets) so demonstrations match student perceptual limitations.",
    "Evaluate the impact of asymmetry reduction on closed-loop robustness and driving metrics in simulated scenarios."

  "impact": "By aligning expert demonstrations with what sensor-based learners actually perceive, practitioners can train more robust, realistic imitation policies in simulation that transfer better to closed-loop driving tasks.",
