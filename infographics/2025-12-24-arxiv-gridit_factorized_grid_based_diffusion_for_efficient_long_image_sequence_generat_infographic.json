  "key_insight": "Represent long image sequences as factorized spatial grids instead of single giant stacked tensors, enabling diffusion models to generate much longer sequences with dramatically lower compute and memory while preserving temporal coherence.",
  "problem_solved": "Current sequence-generation models treat videos/long image streams as huge stacked-frame tensors, causing quadratic memory/compute growth, slow sampling, and poor scalability for long or high-resolution sequences. This work addresses those bottlenecks to make long-sequence generative modeling practical.",

    "Factorized grid representation: split frames into a regular spatial grid of patches/cells and model each cell with a diffusion process rather than a single large tensor of stacked frames.",
    "Grid-based diffusion with factorized conditionals: perform denoising locally on grid cells while using lightweight cross-cell communication (hierarchical/global tokens or sparse attention) to maintain spatial and temporal coherence.",
