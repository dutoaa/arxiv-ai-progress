  "key_insight": "An exploratory RCT with N=165 UK secondary students shows that a pedagogy‑tuned generative model (LearnLM) integrated into chat‑based math tutoring can safely support and improve classroom learning, offering scalable one‑to‑one assistance.",
  "problem_solved": "Addresses the gap between high‑effectiveness one‑to‑one tutoring and its prohibitive cost/scale by testing whether generative AI can deliver safe, effective personalized support in real classrooms.",
  "method": [
    "Exploratory randomized controlled trial (N = 165) across five UK secondary schools evaluating AI‑assisted tutoring on the Eedi mathematics platform.",
    "Integrated LearnLM (a generative model fine‑tuned for pedagogy) into chat‑based tutoring sessions with teacher oversight and safety monitoring.",
    "Measured learning outcomes, engagement, and safety/quality of feedback versus control conditions using pre/post assessments and classroom observations."
