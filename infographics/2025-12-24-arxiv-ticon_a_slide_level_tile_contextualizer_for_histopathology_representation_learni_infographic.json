  "key_insight": "TICON uses a slide-level transformer to enrich isolated tile embeddings with contextual information from the whole slide, producing versatile, context-aware representations that improve both local (tile-level) and global (slide-level) pathology tasks.",
  "problem_solved": "Overcomes the limitation of conventional pipelines that encode tiles independently, which lose crucial slide-level spatial and semantic context needed for accurate histopathology analysis.",
  "method": [
    "Extracts fixed tile embeddings from a pretrained tile encoder, then feeds tile tokens plus positional/slide cues into a transformer-based contextualizer to produce contextualized tile representations.",
    "Learns cross-tile interactions via attention so each tile embedding reflects local appearance and global slide context; designed as a plug-and-play module usable for diverse downstream tasks (classification, segmentation, prognostics).",
    "Training objectives/strategies (e.g., contrastive or reconstruction losses and slide-aware masking) encourage robust, transferable slide-level features while preserving tile locality."

  "impact": "Provides practitioners a drop-in way to make tile features context-aware, improving performance and generalization on WSI tasks without retraining heavy tile encoders — accelerating development of more accurate, clinically relevant pathology models.",
