  "key_insight": "GateFusion introduces a Hierarchical Gated Fusion Decoder that enables fine-grained, multi-level cross-modal interactions between pretrained audio and visual encoders, improving active speaker detection beyond conventional late-fusion approaches.",
  "problem_solved": "Late fusion of audio and visual signals misses fine-grained, time- and space-varying cross-modal cues, reducing robustness in unconstrained videos (noise, overlapping speech, non-speaking mouth motion). GateFusion addresses this by selectively gating and fusing information at multiple hierarchical levels.",

    "Leverage strong pretrained unimodal encoders (visual and audio) as feature backbones.",
    "Introduce a Hierarchical Gated Fusion Decoder (HiGat) that performs multi-level fusion: learned gates control information flow across modalities and layers to capture fine-grained spatio-temporal interactions.",
    "Lightweight, modular fusion allows end-to-end fine-tuning or plug-and-play integration with existing encoders for robust frame-wise active speaker prediction."

  "impact": "Provides a practical, modular way to substantially improve robustness and precision of active speaker detection in real-world video; useful for AV analytics, conference systems, and multimodal research where subtle cross-modal cues matter.",
