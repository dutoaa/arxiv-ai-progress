    "Fuse multimodal representations of compounds and targets (e.g., molecular graphs, sequences/structural features, experimental covariates) into a joint prediction model.",
    "Produce individual uncertainty estimates and OOD flags for each prediction to calibrate confidence and selectively downweight or flag risky predictions.",
    "Evaluate on cross‑target/polypharmacology benchmarks to show improved calibration, robustness, and actionable accuracy compared to baselines."
