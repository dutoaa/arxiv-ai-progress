    "Context-rich editing network: condition on the full frame and audio to edit lip motion only (not re-generate whole regions), decoupling synchronization from content hallucination.",
    "Multi-objective training: combine lip-sync losses, identity-preservation and perceptual/temporal consistency objectives so edits remain realistic and stable over time."

  "impact": "Produces more realistic, identity-consistent dubbed videos with fewer visual artifacts and better temporal stability, making audio-driven dubbing more practical for film, localization, and content-creation pipelines.",
