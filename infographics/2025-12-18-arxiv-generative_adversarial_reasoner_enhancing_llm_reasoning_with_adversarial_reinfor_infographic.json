  "key_insight": "Jointly train an LLM reasoner and an LLM-based discriminator with on-policy adversarial reinforcement learning (plus a compute‑efficient review schedule) so the reasoner learns to avoid process errors in chain-of-thought reasoning. This co-evolution reduces incorrect calculations, brittle logic, and superficially plausible but invalid steps.",
  "problem_solved": "LLMs with explicit reasoning still make process errors (wrong calculations, fragile logical steps, and plausible-but-invalid reasoning). The paper addresses improving the correctness and robustness of multi-step reasoning by using an adversarial critic to shape reasoning behavior.",

  "impact": "Makes chain-of-thought LLMs more reliable and trustworthy by reducing process-level errors, enabling safer deployment in math, logic, and reasoning-heavy applications. Practical for practitioners seeking improved reasoning quality without exorbitant compute overhead.",
