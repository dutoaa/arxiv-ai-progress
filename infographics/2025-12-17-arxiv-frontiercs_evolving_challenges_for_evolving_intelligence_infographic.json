    "Curate 156 diverse, open-ended CS problems across multiple subfields (algorithms, systems, theory, ML, etc.) designed and reviewed by CS PhDs and top competitive programmers.",
    "Require models to output executable programs; evaluate submissions with objective, empirical metrics (correctness, performance, robustness, resource use) via automated test harnesses.",
    "Provide graded difficulty and expert metadata to enable leaderboard-style benchmarking and analysis of solution strategies and generalization."
