  "key_insight": "StreamAvatar introduces a streaming-capable diffusion architecture that makes real-time, interactive full-body human avatars possible by converting diffusion generation into a causal, low-latency pipeline. It preserves high-fidelity appearance while supporting continuous gestures and body motion beyond head-and-shoulder rigs.",
  "problem_solved": "Addresses the non-causal, compute-heavy nature of diffusion-based avatar generation and the limited spatial scope of prior interactive methods (typically head-and-shoulder), enabling low-latency, full-body streaming interaction.",

    "Two-stage streaming architecture: a lightweight, causal streaming stage for coarse, low-latency frame-by-frame poses followed by a refinement diffusion stage for high-fidelity appearance.",
    "Temporal conditioning and autoregressive/frame-cached inference to make diffusion causal and efficient for continuous streams.",
    "Body-aware conditioning (pose, skeleton, or control signals) to extend generation from head-and-shoulder to full-body gestures and motions."

  "impact": "Makes diffusion-quality avatars usable in real-time applications (telepresence, virtual assistants, gaming) by trading off a small quality/compute overhead for large reductions in latency; provides a practical blueprint for integrating streaming diffusion into interactive ML systems.",
