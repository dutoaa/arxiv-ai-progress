    "Use pretrained VLMs to score/compare original vs. compressed images (zero-shot or lightly calibrated) as proxy human preference judgments.",

  "impact": "Enables development of compression systems that better match human perception without expensive large-scale psychophysical data collection; practitioners can plug VLM-based judges into training and evaluation pipelines for more human-aligned outputs.",
