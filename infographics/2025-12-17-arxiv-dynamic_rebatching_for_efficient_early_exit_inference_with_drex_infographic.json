  "key_insight": "DREX dynamically regroup batches at inference time so tokens/requests that are ready to exit can leave early without stalling others, improving GPU utilization and lowering latency while preserving output quality.",
  "problem_solved": "Traditional static batching is incompatible with Early-Exit LLMs because requests exit at different layers; existing fixes either waste compute by forcing late exits or hurt quality by forcing premature exits.",
  "method": [
    "Monitor per-token/request exit readiness (e.g., confidence scores) during layer-by-layer inference and mark candidates for exit.",
    "Dynamically split and reassemble micro-batches on-the-fly so ready items exit immediately while others continue through deeper layers, maximizing hardware utilization.",
    "Lightweight scheduler that balances throughput vs. latency targets and enforces quality thresholds to avoid premature exits."
  ],
  "impact": "Enables practical deployment of Early-Exit LLMs by reducing average latency and increasing throughput without degrading accuracy, yielding cost and energy savings for real-time and large-scale inference.",
