  "key_insight": "Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) can serve as accurate perceptual judges by replicating human binary preference judgments, enabling human-aligned image compression without large psychophysical training sets.",
  "problem_solved": "Traditional distortion metrics (e.g., MSE) and bespoke perceptual networks often fail to match human preferences; collecting and training on large-scale human judgments is expensive and slow. This work provides a scalable alternative for perceptual evaluation and loss.",
  "method": [
    "Use off-the-shelf VLMs to compare original vs. compressed images and predict binary human preference signals.",
    "Convert VLM preference outputs into a perceptual evaluation metric (and optionally a differentiable loss) for training or selecting compression models.",
    "Calibrate VLM outputs to align with human binary judgments so the model can be used as a reliable proxy judge."

  "impact": "This approach offers a scalable, plug-in perceptual judge that lets practitioners optimize compressors for human-perceived quality without costly psychophysical labeling, improving perceived quality at comparable bitrates and speeding development cycles.",
