  "impact": "Enables more reliable, interpretable UAV navigation in long missions and dynamic real-world scenarios, improving applicability of VLN systems for search-and-rescue and other field robotics tasks. Practitioners can adopt its spatiotemporal integration ideas to enhance multi-modal grounding and planning in other long-horizon agents.",
