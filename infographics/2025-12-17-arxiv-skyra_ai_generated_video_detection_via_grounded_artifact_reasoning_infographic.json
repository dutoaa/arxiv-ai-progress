  "key_insight": "Skyra is a multimodal LLM that does more than binary detection: it identifies human‑perceivable visual artifacts in AI‑generated videos and produces grounded, human‑readable evidence (artifact types, locations, timestamps) to explain its decisions.",
  "problem_solved": "Existing AI‑generated video detectors largely give only binary labels and lack interpretable, actionable explanations or artifact localization, hindering human verification and forensic workflows.",
  "method": [
    "Train/fine‑tune a multimodal large language model to recognize and describe visual artifacts in video frames and aggregate evidence over time.",
    "Produce grounded outputs: artifact type labels, localized regions/timestamps, and natural‑language rationales that link visual cues to a generation hypothesis.",
    "Combine frame‑level visual feature analysis with temporal reasoning to form a concise, evidence‑backed verdict rather than an opaque score."
  ],
  "impact": "Skyra enables explainable, evidence‑based detection of AI‑generated videos, improving trust, human review efficiency, and deployment in forensic or moderation systems. Practitioners can integrate artifact explanations to prioritize investigations and meet transparency requirements.",
