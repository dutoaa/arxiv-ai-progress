    "Design a modular teleoperation interface that decomposes control into intuitive submodules: hand-eye coordination, grasp primitives, arm end-effector tracking, and locomotion.",
    "Introduce \"choice policies\" (a scalable selector/gating mechanism) that dynamically choose and blend among submodules to produce coherent whole-body actions.",
    "Train the system from teleoperation demonstrations and scalable learning (imitation + reinforcement-style refinement) to generalize coordinated behaviors and enable sim-to-real transfer."
