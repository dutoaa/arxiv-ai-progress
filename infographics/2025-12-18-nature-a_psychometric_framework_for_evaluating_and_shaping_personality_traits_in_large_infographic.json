  "key_insight": "Standard psychometric tests can be adapted to reliably measure personality-like traits in instruction-tuned LLMs, and those trait profiles can be induced and validated in downstream tasks.",

  "method": [
    "Adapt established psychometric instruments (e.g., Big Five questionnaires) into promptable formats for LLM responses.",
    "Evaluate measurement quality with psychometric analyses (reliability, factor structure, convergent/discriminant validity) across model families and settings.",
    "Shape or induce target personality profiles via conditioning/instruction-tuning and test transferability in downstream tasks."

  "impact": "Provides AI practitioners a reproducible toolkit for evaluating, customizing, and validating model personas—enabling controlled behavior design, better user experience, and more rigorous alignment/evaluation pipelines.",
