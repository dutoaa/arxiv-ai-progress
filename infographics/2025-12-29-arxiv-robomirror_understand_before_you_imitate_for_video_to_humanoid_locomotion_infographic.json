  "key_insight": "RoboMirror introduces an explicit visual-understanding stage before imitation, extracting semantic intent from videos and using those semantics to drive humanoid locomotion—shifting from mechanical pose-mimicry to intent-driven control.",
  "problem_solved": "Bridges the gap between raw video observations and robust humanoid locomotion by overcoming semantic sparsity and staged-pipeline errors in text-based or pose-only imitation methods, enabling learning from in-the-wild videos rather than curated mocap or sparse text commands.",
  "method": [
    "Visual understanding module: parse input video into semantic locomotion intents/affordances (e.g., speed, stepping pattern, obstacles) rather than raw pose sequences.",
    "Intent-conditioned controller: train a humanoid policy that maps semantic representations to dynamically feasible locomotion actions, closing perception-to-control loop.",
    "Joint training/transfer: align visual semantics and control via imitation/reinforcement learning to improve robustness and reduce staging errors from separate pipelines."

  "impact": "Enables practitioners to train humanoid controllers from unconstrained video data with more natural, adaptable behaviors; reduces dependence on mocap datasets and brittle text prompts, improving real-world applicability of video-to-motion systems.",
