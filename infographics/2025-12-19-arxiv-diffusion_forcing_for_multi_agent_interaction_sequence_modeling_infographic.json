  "impact": "Provides a general, scalable method for realistic multi-agent sequence generation useful for robotics, simulation, social behavior modeling and downstream planning tasks. Practitioners can leverage MAGNet to synthesize coordinated group behaviors and improve multi-agent prediction benchmarks.",
