  "key_insight": "Parallel Token Prediction (PTP) lets a transformer predict multiple dependent tokens in one forward pass by integrating the sampling process into the model, enabling parallel decoding without making independence assumptions or sacrificing the expressivity of autoregressive distributions.",
  "problem_solved": "Autoregressive decoding is latency-bound because tokens are generated sequentially; existing multi-token approaches rely on independence assumptions that harm quality. PTP addresses both speed and dependency modeling simultaneously.",
  "method": [
    "Jointly predict blocks of dependent tokens in a single transformer call instead of token-by-token autoregression.",
    "Incorporate the sampling procedure into the model so predicted tokens account for mutual dependencies rather than being treated independently.",
    "Provide theoretical guarantees: PTP can represent arbitrary autoregressive sequence distributions, preserving expressivity while enabling parallelism."
  ],
  "impact": "PTP reduces generation latency and improves throughput for large-scale language model deployment while maintaining generation fidelity, making faster, high-quality inference practical for production systems and research experiments.",
