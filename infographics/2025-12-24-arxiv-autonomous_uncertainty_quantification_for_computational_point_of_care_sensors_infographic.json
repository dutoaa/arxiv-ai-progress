  "key_insight": "Embedding autonomous uncertainty quantification into computational point-of-care sensors lets models output both a diagnosis and a calibrated confidence score, enabling automatic flagging or safe abstention when predictions are unreliable.",
  "problem_solved": "Neural-network diagnostics for low-cost POC sensors can hallucinate or produce overconfident, erroneous predictions; this work addresses the lack of on-device, actionable uncertainty estimates that reduce misdiagnosis risk in resource-limited settings.",
  "method": [
    "Integrate a lightweight uncertainty-quantification module with the diagnostic neural network to produce calibrated confidence alongside predictions.",
    "Implement simple, actionable decision rules (e.g., abstain, request retest, escalate to clinician) based on confidence thresholds to triage low-confidence cases.",
    "Validate the approach on representative POC sensor datasets to show maintained diagnostic accuracy while improving reliability and safety of automated outputs."
