  "key_insight": "Integrating visual context directly into the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning process enables unified models to maintain high-fidelity visual consistency across multi-reference multimodal generation, preserving key visual attributes that plain text-focused CoT systems miss.",
  "problem_solved": "Current CoT-based unified models optimize for textual coherence but often ignore alignment with reference images, causing failures to preserve critical visual features (e.g., identity, color, object attributes) in multi-image or multi-reference generation tasks.",
  "method": [
    "Augment CoT with visual-aware reasoning states: inject image features and cross-modal alignment cues into each reasoning step so the model explicitly tracks visual attributes while generating.",
    "Introduce cross-attention and visual-consistency objectives during decoding to enforce preservation of reference-specific features across outputs.",
    "Use a modular pipeline that combines visual feature alignment, stepwise multimodal reasoning, and fidelity-aware loss terms to balance textual and visual consistency."
  ],
  "impact": "This approach yields more reliable multimodal outputs for tasks like image editing, multi-image storytelling, and reference-guided generation, reducing hallucinations and improving fidelity to provided visual references—making unified models more trustworthy for real-world multimodal applications.",
