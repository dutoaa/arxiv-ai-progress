  "key_insight": "AnyAD introduces a single unified anomaly-detection model that handles any subset of available MRI sequences at inference time (including unseen combinations) without retraining, by learning a modality-agnostic latent representation and cross-modal reconstruction.",
  "problem_solved": "Clinical brain MRI often has missing or variable combinations of sequences, and prior AD models require fixed modality inputs or repeated training for different combinations; AnyAD solves scalable anomaly detection across incomplete multi-sequence MRI data.",
  "method": [
    "Train a single modality-agnostic encoder–decoder with a shared latent space so any subset of sequences can be encoded and used for reconstruction or cross-modal synthesis.",
    "Use random modality masking/dropout during training to simulate incomplete inputs and force the model to generalize to unseen modality combinations.",
    "Compute anomaly scores from reconstruction discrepancies and uncertainty estimates in the shared latent/reconstruction space to detect abnormal regions robustly."
  ],
  "impact": "Provides a practical, deployable AD solution for real-world MRI workflows where sequences are frequently missing, reducing the need for multiple specialized models and enabling consistent anomaly screening across variable clinical inputs.",
