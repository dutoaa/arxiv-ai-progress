  "key_insight": "SpaceTimePilot disentangles spatial (camera viewpoint) and temporal (motion sequence) factors inside a video diffusion model, enabling independent, continuous control of where and when a scene is rendered from a single monocular video. It introduces an animation time-embedding in the diffusion process to explicitly steer motion while separately controlling viewpoint.",
  "problem_solved": "How to controllably re-render dynamic scenes from a single monocular video so users can independently change camera viewpoint and the motion sequence for continuous exploration across space and time.",

    "Design a video diffusion model that separates space (camera viewpoint) and time (animation/motion) representations during generation.",
    "Introduce an animation time-embedding mechanism inside the diffusion process to provide explicit, fine-grained control over motion trajectories and temporal structure.",
    "Condition the generative process on a monocular input video (and camera controls) to re-render the scene at arbitrary viewpoints and modified motion sequences."
