  "key_insight": "A compact, structured latent built from a new sparse omni-voxel (O-Voxel) representation encodes geometry and appearance natively, enabling high-fidelity 3D generation that handles complex topologies with far fewer resources.",
  "problem_solved": "Existing 3D representations struggle to represent complex topology and fine appearance jointly and/or are inefficient; this work provides a native, compact latent that preserves topology and appearance from raw 3D data.",

    "Define O-Voxel: a sparse, per-voxel omni-channel structure that stores both geometry cues and appearance features in native 3D space.",
    "Learn compact structured latents from native 3D assets by encoding into the O-Voxel sparsity-aware representation and decoding back for generation or rendering.",
    "Design training and compression strategies that exploit sparsity and structure so latents remain compact while preserving topology and detailed appearance."
