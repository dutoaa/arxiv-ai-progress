  "key_insight": "What looks like a reasoning failure on abstract-reasoning benchmarks (ARC, ARC-AGI) is largely caused by a perception bottleneck: noisy/ambiguous visual encoding, not core reasoning, explains much of the gap between humans and vision–language models.",
  "problem_solved": "Clarifies whether low performance on abstract visual reasoning benchmarks reflects deficits in reasoning or in front-end perception/representation, and provides empirical evidence that perception is the primary limiter.",
  "method": [
    "Separate perception from reasoning by comparing model performance on raw images versus idealized / oracle symbolic representations.",
    "Run controlled ablations and diagnostics on VLMs (e.g., replace visual encoder with perfect/cleaned masks or structured tokens) to measure the effect of perceptual noise.",
    "Evaluate across ARC and ARC-AGI tasks to quantify how much performance improves when perception errors are removed or reduced."
  ],
  "impact": "Helps researchers and practitioners avoid misattributing failures to reasoning, guiding efforts toward better perceptual front-ends, dataset design, and more diagnostic benchmarks that disentangle perception from reasoning.",
