    "Use pretrained VLMs to score or compare original vs. compressed image pairs (A/B preferences) by leveraging vision-language similarity/contrastive signals.",
    "Convert VLM judgments into a perceptual objective or ranking loss that guides training of compression models, optionally using frozen VLM embeddings or differentiable similarity measures.",
    "Validate alignment by measuring correlation with human preference studies and comparing rate–distortion trade-offs against standard perceptual losses and baselines."
