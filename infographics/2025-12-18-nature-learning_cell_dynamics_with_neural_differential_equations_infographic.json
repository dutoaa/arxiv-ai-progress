This enables simulation of perturbations to probe development and disease processes.",

    "Fit a neural SDE where both drift and diffusion are parameterized by neural networks conditioned on the cell state (state-dependent noise and mean dynamics).",

    "Use the learned dynamics to simulate perturbations (counterfactual interventions) and compare emergent trajectories for developmental or disease hypotheses."
