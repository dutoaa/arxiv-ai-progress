  "key_insight": "FrontierCS introduces a curated benchmark of 156 open-ended computer science problems where optimal answers are unknown but solution quality can be objectively measured, enabling evaluation of models' creative, executable problem-solving abilities. It shifts benchmarking from closed-form tasks to expert-designed, real-world-like challenges.",
  "problem_solved": "Existing benchmarks emphasize tasks with known optimal solutions and reward rote performance; FrontierCS addresses the lack of standardized evaluation for open-ended, creative, and executable CS problems where progress is measured by solution quality rather than a single correct answer.",
  "method": [
    "Curate 156 diverse, open-ended CS problems (designed and reviewed by CS PhDs, competitive programmers, and problem setters).",
    "Require models to produce executable programs or artifacts that can be objectively evaluated by automated tests, performance metrics, or expert review.",
    "Provide a standardized evaluation pipeline and metrics to compare solution quality across problems and models."
  ],
  "impact": "FrontierCS provides practitioners a practical benchmark to develop and compare models on creative programming, system design, and research-style problems, promoting progress in generalization, synthesis, and real-world utility beyond fixed-answer tasks.",
