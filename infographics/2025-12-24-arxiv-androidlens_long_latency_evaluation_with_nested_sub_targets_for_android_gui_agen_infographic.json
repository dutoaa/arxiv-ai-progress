  "key_insight": "AndroidLens introduces a large-scale, bilingual benchmark of 571 realistic, long-latency Android GUI tasks (average >26 steps) with nested sub-targets and fine-grained evaluation, enabling realistic assessment of GUI agents' long-horizon capabilities.",
  "problem_solved": "Existing GUI-agent evaluations are limited to few apps, short/simple tasks, and coarse metrics; AndroidLens fills this gap by providing challenging, multi-step tasks and structured targets to measure true long-horizon performance.",
  "method": [
    "Curate 571 long-latency tasks across real Android apps in both Chinese and English to reflect realistic user scenarios.",
    "Annotate tasks with nested sub-targets to allow stepwise, fine-grained evaluation (sub-goal tracking + final goal success).",
    "Provide an evaluation harness and metrics focused on long-horizon behavior (task length, sub-target completion, error propagation, success rate)."
  ],
  "impact": "Researchers and practitioners get a realistic, multilingual benchmark to stress-test planning, memory, and robustness of GUI agents, accelerating progress on agents that perform complex, multi-step mobile workflows.",
