  "key_insight": "Incorporating visual-awareness into the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process lets unified models reason in a way that preserves and aligns generated text with key visual features from reference images, improving multi-reference visual consistency.",
  "problem_solved": "Current CoT-guided multi-modal generation optimizes textual consistency with prompts but neglects consistency with visual references, causing failures to maintain important visual attributes across multi-image or multi-reference outputs.",
  "method": [
    "Augment CoT with visual-aware reasoning steps: inject visual grounding cues and image-conditioned prompts into the chain-of-thought so each reasoning step is explicitly tied to visual evidence.",
    "Align intermediate textual reasoning and visual features via attention regularization or contrastive alignment, enforcing that CoT tokens attend to and preserve key image attributes across steps.",
    "Optimize with visual-consistency objectives and benchmark on multi-reference tasks to ensure outputs retain salient visual details (e.g., identity, color, spatial relations) across generated content."

  "impact": "This approach yields higher-fidelity, image-consistent multi-modal outputs, enabling more reliable VQA, grounded captioning, multi-image editing and other vision-language applications where preserving visual attributes matters.",
