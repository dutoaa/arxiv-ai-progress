  "key_insight": "AndroidLens provides a challenging, bilingual benchmark of long‑latency Android GUI tasks with nested sub‑targets and fine‑grained step evaluation, revealing capabilities and failure modes that coarse benchmarks miss.",
  "problem_solved": "Existing GUI agent evaluations are limited to few apps, simple tasks, and coarse metrics; AndroidLens fills the gap by offering a diverse, realistic set of long‑latency tasks and more precise evaluation criteria.",
  "method": [
    "Curate 571 long‑latency Android tasks (Chinese & English) each requiring on average >26 steps, reflecting real mobile workflows.",
    "Structure tasks with nested sub‑targets to capture multi‑stage objectives and partial progress, enabling step‑level success/failure assessment.",
    "Provide evaluation protocols and metrics that go beyond single end‑state checks to measure intermediate correctness, robustness, and retry behavior."
  ],
  "impact": "AndroidLens enables researchers and practitioners to benchmark mobile GUI agents against realistic, complex workflows and to diagnose fine‑grained weaknesses, accelerating progress on robust, multilingual, long‑latency automation.",
  "visual_elements": [
    "Flow diagram of a long‑latency task showing nested sub‑targets and average >26 steps (with checkpoints for step‑level scoring).",
    "Bar chart comparing coarse vs. fine‑grained evaluation outcomes (e.g., end‑state success vs. intermediate success rates).",
    "Heatmap or mosaic of supported apps/languages showing task distribution across Chinese and English environments.",
