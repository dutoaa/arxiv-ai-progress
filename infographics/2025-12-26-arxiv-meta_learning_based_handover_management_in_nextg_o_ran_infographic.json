  "key_insight": "A meta-learning controller in O-RAN can quickly adapt handover policies per-location and per-user, combining Conditional and Traditional HOs to improve reliability while controlling signaling and resource costs.",
  "problem_solved": "Balancing the trade-offs between Traditional Handover (THO) and Conditional Handover (CHO) — e.g., failures, delays, signaling overhead and resource reservations — across diverse, large-scale mobile deployments.",
  "method": [
    "Integrate a meta-learning agent into the O-RAN RIC that learns a shared prior over handover policies from many locations and tasks.",
    "At deployment, perform fast adaptation (few-shot fine-tuning) to local mobility patterns to select or blend CHO/THO strategies that optimize reliability vs. signaling/resource use.",
    "Evaluate policies using realistic countrywide mobility traces and network KPIs (handover success, latency, signaling volume) to guide online updates."

  "impact": "Provides a practical blueprint for applying meta-learning to network control: enables ML practitioners to build controllers that generalize across environments and adapt rapidly in production O-RAN systems, improving QoE and operational efficiency without heavy re-training.",
