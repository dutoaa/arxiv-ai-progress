  "key_insight": "Reducing the information and uncertainty gap between privileged experts and sensor-based learners substantially improves closed-loop driving robustness; aligning what the expert 'sees' with what the student can observe is key.",
  "problem_solved": "Imitation learning in driving often fails in closed-loop because privileged expert demonstrations (with perfect visibility and low uncertainty) do not match sensor-limited student observations, causing learned policies to overfit to unattainable cues.",

    "Formalize and measure learner–expert asymmetry arising from visibility and uncertainty differences between privileged experts and sensor-based students.",
    "Minimize asymmetry during training by degrading or masking expert inputs to match student sensors, adding realistic uncertainty, and using asymmetry-aware training objectives (LEAD).",
    "Evaluate improvements via closed-loop driving metrics in simulation to verify robustness gains from the asymmetry-reduction interventions."

  "impact": "Practitioners get a practical strategy (LEAD) to close the gap between simulator experts and real-world sensors, leading to more robust end-to-end driving policies and better sim-to-real transfer without relying on privileged information at test time.",
