  "key_insight": "HiStream cuts the huge inference cost of high-resolution video diffusion by eliminating redundant computation: denoise at low resolution, stream the video in chunks, and reuse cached features to cheaply refine to high resolution.",
  "problem_solved": "High-resolution video generation with diffusion models is computationally and memory intensive (quadratic complexity), making practical inference infeasible for long or high-res videos due to repeated, redundant computations across spatial resolution, temporal frames, and denoising steps.",
  "method": [
    "Spatial compression — perform denoising at low resolution first, then refine to high resolution using cached multi-scale features to avoid re-computing heavy high-res convolutions.",
    "Temporal compression — generate video chunk-by-chunk (streaming) with overlapped context and feature reuse to avoid repeatedly processing the entire temporal sequence.",
    "Cross-step feature reuse — cache and reuse intermediate denoising features across steps and frames so redundant per-step computations are skipped."

  "impact": "HiStream significantly lowers compute, memory, and latency for high-res video diffusion, enabling practical generation and faster iteration on commodity hardware — useful for video production, editing, and real-time or low-cost deployment.",
