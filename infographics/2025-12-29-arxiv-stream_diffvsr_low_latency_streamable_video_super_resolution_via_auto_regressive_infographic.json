  "key_insight": "Stream-DiffVSR enables high-quality, perceptual video super-resolution in streaming/online settings by using a causally conditioned diffusion model with a distilled 4-step denoiser and auto-regressive temporal guidance to avoid future-frame dependency and multi-step latency.",
  "problem_solved": "Existing diffusion-based VSR methods require future frames and many denoising steps, making them too slow and impractical for latency-sensitive, real-time or streaming applications.",
  "method": [
    "Causal conditioning: model operates strictly on past frames (no future frames) to support online/streaming use.",
    "Four-step distilled denoiser: highly accelerated diffusion inference via 4-step distillation for low-latency outputs.",
    "Auto-regressive Temporal Guidance (ARTG): injects motion-aligned, auto-regressive cues to preserve temporal consistency and improve per-frame perceptual quality."
  ],
  "impact": "Enables deployment of perceptually strong VSR in real-time/streaming pipelines (e.g., video conferencing, live broadcast, edge devices) by cutting latency and compute while retaining diffusion-quality outputs.",
