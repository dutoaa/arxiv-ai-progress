  "key_insight": "Widespread use of LLMs in scholarly writing creates a provenance problem: it becomes difficult to trace which claims, text, and citations originated from humans versus models, undermining accountability, reproducibility, and research integrity.",
  "problem_solved": "The paper identifies and characterizes the gap in provenance — the inability to reliably document, attribute, and audit the origins of content produced or assisted by LLMs in academic manuscripts — and proposes concrete ways to close that gap.",
  "method": [
    "Conceptual analysis and taxonomy of provenance failure modes that arise when LLMs are used in scholarly text production (e.g., hallucinated citations, blended authorship).",
    "Examination of representative examples and policy implications to show how current practices obscure origin and responsibility.",
    "Proposal of practical requirements and reporting practices (metadata, audit trails, and tooling) to restore traceability and accountability."

  "impact": "For AI/ML practitioners, adopting provenance-aware practices (metadata, tooling, and reporting standards) preserves reproducibility, supports peer review, and reduces legal and ethical risks associated with model-generated or model-assisted scholarly content.",
