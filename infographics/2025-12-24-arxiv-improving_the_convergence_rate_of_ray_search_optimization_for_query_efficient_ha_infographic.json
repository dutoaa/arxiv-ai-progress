    "Formulate hard‑label attack as searching for an optimal ray direction whose scaled ℓ2 perturbation first crosses the adversarial decision boundary.",

    "Provide theoretical convergence-rate improvements and validate empirically to demonstrate large query savings versus prior ray‑search baselines."

  "impact": "Significantly fewer queries make hard‑label attacks more practical for real‑world evaluation and stress‑testing of deployed models, and provide a stronger, more query‑efficient baseline for robustness research.",
