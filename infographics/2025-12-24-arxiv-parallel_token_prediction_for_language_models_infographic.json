  "key_insight": "Parallel Token Prediction (PTP) lets a transformer predict multiple dependent tokens in one forward pass by embedding the sampling procedure into the model, eliminating the sequential decoding bottleneck while preserving dependency structure. The authors prove PTP can represent any autoregressive sequence distribution.",
  "problem_solved": "Reduces the latency and inefficiency of autoregressive decoding, which requires many sequential transformer calls and often forces independence assumptions in multi-token prediction methods.",
  "method": [
    "Integrate the sampling process into the model so it jointly outputs blocks of dependent tokens in a single transformer call.",
    "Design a training/inference scheme that preserves token dependencies (avoids restrictive independence assumptions) while enabling parallel generation.",
    "Provide theoretical proof that the framework can represent arbitrary autoregressive sequence distributions, ensuring expressivity is retained."
  ],
  "impact": "PTP enables much faster sequence generation without sacrificing sample quality or expressivity, making low-latency inference (e.g., real-time applications, edge devices, high-throughput servers) more practical for large language models.",
