  "key_insight": "A scene-centric, zero-shot system that reconstructs metric in-scene object manipulations from monocular RGB video by combining foundation-model initializations with joint optimization for physically plausible hand–object–scene interactions. This yields accurate, usable 3D reconstructions without per-scene training.",
  "problem_solved": "Reconstructing in-scene object manipulation from a single RGB video — overcoming ill-posed scene reconstruction, ambiguous hand–object depth, and the need for physically plausible interactions that prior hand-centric methods ignored.",

    "Initialize core components (object mesh, hand pose, and scene geometry) using data-driven foundation models from raw monocular RGB.",
    "Optimize all elements jointly in a shared scene (metric) coordinate frame with contact, depth, and physics-informed priors to disambiguate hand–object depth and ensure plausible interactions.",
    "Zero-shot inference: operate without scene-specific training, producing metric-accurate reconstructions suitable for downstream use (e.g., AR/robotics)."
