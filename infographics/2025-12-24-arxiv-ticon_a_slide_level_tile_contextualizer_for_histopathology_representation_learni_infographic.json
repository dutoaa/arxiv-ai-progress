  "key_insight": "TICON is a transformer-based contextualizer that enriches tile embeddings with slide-level information, producing plug-and-play, context-aware representations that improve both local and global histopathology tasks.",
  "problem_solved": "Standard tile-encoder pipelines extract tiles out of their spatial and slide context, losing crucial neighborhood and global cues needed for accurate interpretation across tasks (diagnosis, segmentation, prognosis). TICON restores that missing slide-level context to each tile embedding.",
  "method": [
    "Transformer-based contextualizer that ingests pretrained tile embeddings and models interactions across tiles to inject local and global slide context.",
    "Outputs contextualized tile embeddings compatible with downstream models (drop-in module for existing pipelines).",
    "Design emphasizes capturing neighborhood and slide-level cues so single-tile interpretations benefit from surrounding tissue and global slide patterns."
  ],
  "impact": "Makes tile-level representations more informative and robust for a wide range of computational pathology applications, improving performance and generalization while being easy to integrate into existing workflows.",
