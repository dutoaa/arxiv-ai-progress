  "key_insight": "FrontierCS presents a 156-problem benchmark of expert-crafted, open-ended computer science challenges where optimal solutions are unknown but model-generated solutions can be objectively evaluated via executable programs, enabling assessment of creative, research-like problem solving.",
  "problem_solved": "Existing benchmarks focus on tasks with known optimal answers or narrow objectives; FrontierCS fills the gap by providing diverse, expert-reviewed problems that require synthesis, engineering and open-ended reasoning, with reproducible, objective evaluation of submitted programs.",
  "method": [
    "Curate 156 open-ended problems across multiple CS subfields, designed and reviewed by CS PhDs and top competitive programming problem setters.",
    "Require models to produce executable programs (not just answers); evaluate solutions with objective metrics (correctness, performance, robustness) through automated execution.",
    "Provide infrastructure for repeatable evaluation and comparative benchmarking to track progress on problems without known optima."
  ],
  "impact": "FrontierCS shifts evaluation from fixed-goal tasks to creative, executable problem solving, giving researchers and developers a realistic testbed for improving code generation, long-horizon reasoning, and engineering abilities of AI systems.",
  "visual_elements": [
    "Pie chart or treemap showing distribution of 156 problems across CS subdomains (algorithms, systems, theory, ML, etc.).",
