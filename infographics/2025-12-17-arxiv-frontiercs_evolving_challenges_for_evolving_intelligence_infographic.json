  "key_insight": "FrontierCS is a curated benchmark of 156 open-ended computer science problems that require models to produce executable programs and are objectively evaluable even when an optimal solution is unknown, enabling assessment of creative problem-solving and solution quality beyond traditional closed-form tasks.",
  "problem_solved": "Identifies the gap in current benchmarks which emphasize tasks with known optimal answers and instead provides a standardized suite of challenging, open-ended CS problems (algorithms, systems, design) where solution quality can be measured but optimum is not predefined.",
  "method": [
    "Curate 156 diverse, open-ended CS problems designed and reviewed by CS PhDs, competitive programming experts, and problem setters.",
    "Require models to output executable programs; evaluate solutions by running them and scoring objective metrics (correctness, efficiency, robustness, task-specific quality).",
    "Provide standardized evaluation protocols and examples to compare models on open-ended problem-solving and implementation quality."
  ],
  "impact": "FrontierCS shifts evaluation toward realistic, creative coding and system-design challenges, helping researchers benchmark models on practical program generation and algorithmic reasoning. It encourages development of models that produce high-quality, executable solutions rather than only matching fixed-answer datasets.",
