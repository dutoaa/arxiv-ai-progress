  "key_insight": "Web World Models (WWM) place persistent, controllable agent environments inside ordinary web code — a middle ground that combines the engineering reliability of web frameworks with the flexibility of generative world models.",
  "problem_solved": "Addresses the gap between fixed, database-backed web apps (which are controllable but limited) and fully generative world models (which are flexible but hard to control, reproduce, and engineer). WWM provides persistent, debuggable, and integratable worlds for language agents.",
  "method": [
    "Implement world state and 'physics' as ordinary web code (HTML/JS, server APIs, and databases) so environment behavior is explicit, inspectable, and persistent.",
    "Expose standardized event/HTTP interfaces for language agents to perceive, act, and receive feedback; log and version state for replay and debugging.",
    "Optionally augment deterministic web logic with generative modules (LLMs) for content or behavior, preserving controllability while enabling open-ended scenarios."
