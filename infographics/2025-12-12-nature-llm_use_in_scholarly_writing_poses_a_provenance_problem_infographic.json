  "key_insight": "Using LLMs in scholarly writing creates a provenance problem: model‑generated or model‑edited content can obscure who contributed what, when, and on what evidence, threatening attribution, reproducibility, and accountability.",
  "problem_solved": "The paper addresses the challenge of tracking and documenting the origin and modification history of scholarly text and claims when authors rely on LLMs—a gap that undermines clear authorship, verifiable citations, and reproducible research workflows.",
  "method": [
    "Conceptual analysis of how common scholarly workflows break down when LLMs are introduced, identifying specific provenance failure modes.",
    "Illustrative case examples showing how model outputs and edits can erase or complicate the evidence trail for claims and text.",
    "Recommended mitigations and practices (e.g., machine‑readable metadata, logging/versioning, model disclosure) to restore provenance in writing pipelines."
  ],
  "impact": "For AI/ML practitioners this highlights the need to build models, APIs and authoring tools that preserve verifiable provenance (metadata, audit logs, model fingerprints) so research remains attributable and reproducible. Adopting provenance‑aware design and standards will protect trust in scientific communication.",
