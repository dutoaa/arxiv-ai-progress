  "key_insight": "Injecting explicit world knowledge and lightweight reasoning into sequential recommender models converts sparse, ID-based item signals into rich semantic representations, enabling the model to capture beyond-log user interests and improve robustness under data sparsity.",
  "problem_solved": "Addresses brittle interest modeling caused by ID-only item representations and the inability of log-driven systems to perceive user preferences outside platform interaction histories.",
  "method": [
    "Map ID-based items to semantic world knowledge (e.g., product text, attributes, knowledge graph nodes) to produce content-rich item embeddings.",
    "Apply a reasoning module (retrieval + lightweight inference) to augment user interaction sequences with inferred, beyond-log interests and semantic relations.",
    "Fuse the knowledge-augmented sequence into a sequential modeling backbone (e.g., Transformer/RNN) and train with objectives that encourage generalization and robustness under sparse logs."

  "impact": "Provides a practical pattern to make recommender systems less brittle and more aware of real-world product semantics and latent user intent, improving cold-start handling and cross-platform generalization for practitioners.",
