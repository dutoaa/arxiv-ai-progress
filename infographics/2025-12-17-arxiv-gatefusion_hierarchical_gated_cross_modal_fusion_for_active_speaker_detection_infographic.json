    "Use strong pretrained unimodal encoders for audio and visual streams to extract robust per-frame features.",
    "Introduce a Hierarchical Gated Fusion Decoder (HiGat) that applies learned gating at multiple levels to selectively fuse audio and visual features and capture fine-grained interactions.",
    "Perform cross-modal attention and gated residual connections across hierarchy levels to adaptively emphasize the most relevant modality cues for each frame."
