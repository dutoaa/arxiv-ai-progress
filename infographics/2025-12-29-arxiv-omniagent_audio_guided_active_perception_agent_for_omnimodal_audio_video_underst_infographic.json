  "key_insight": "OmniAgent uses audio cues as an active control signal to dynamically steer perception and tool selection, enabling finer-grained audio–visual alignment and reasoning than static, frame‑dense pipelines. By orchestrating specialized tools on demand, it achieves more precise multimodal understanding with less redundant visual processing.",
  "problem_solved": "Addresses the weak cross-modal alignment and coarse audio–visual reasoning in omnimodal LLMs caused by rigid, dense frame-caption workflows and lack of targeted perception driven by audio events.",
  "method": [
    "Audio-guided active perception: audio modules detect events and issue focused visual queries rather than processing all frames uniformly.",
    "Dynamic tool orchestration: an agent controller invokes specialized vision/audio tools (object recognizers, temporal localizers, captioners) on demand to obtain fine-grained, task-relevant signals.",
    "Iterative multimodal reasoning: the agent fuses incremental tool outputs into the omnimodal LLM for aligned, stepwise audio–visual inference and answer generation."

  "impact": "Enables more efficient and accurate multimodal systems by reducing visual redundancy and improving alignment — useful for audio-driven video understanding, surveillance, robotics, and multimodal evaluation benchmarks. Practitioners can build scalable pipelines that target relevant moments rather than processing everything exhaustively.",
