  "key_insight": "An exploratory randomized controlled trial (N=165, five UK secondary schools) indicates that LearnLM — a generative model fine-tuned for pedagogy and deployed via chat-based tutoring on the Eedi platform — can support students safely and effectively in classroom math instruction.",
  "problem_solved": "Addresses the scalability gap of one-to-one personalized tutoring by exploring whether generative AI can provide effective, safe, and classroom-ready tutoring support.",
  "method": [
    "Conducted an exploratory RCT with 165 students across five UK secondary schools using integrated chat-based tutoring on the Eedi mathematics platform.",
    "Deployed LearnLM, a generative model fine-tuned for pedagogy, to run tutoring sessions alongside classroom instruction and monitoring.",
    "Evaluated outcomes and safety through classroom deployment and controlled comparison (pre/post and between-group measures) to assess learning impact and potential risks."
  ],
  "impact": "Provides evidence that pedagogy-focused fine-tuning plus careful classroom evaluation can yield practical, safe AI tutoring—encouraging ML practitioners to prioritize domain-specific tuning, rigorous field trials (e.g., RCTs), and safety guardrails when building educational models.",
