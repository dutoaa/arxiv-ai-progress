    "Training-free conversion: take a pretrained feed-forward 4D model and adapt it for streaming at inference time without weight updates.",
    "Layer-wise scale alignment: adjust per-layer activation scales/statistics across temporal windows so features remain stable and causal when processed incrementally.",
    "Memory-efficient buffering & temporal aggregation: reuse aligned layer outputs and maintain lightweight buffers to achieve near-linear memory cost while preserving reconstruction quality."
