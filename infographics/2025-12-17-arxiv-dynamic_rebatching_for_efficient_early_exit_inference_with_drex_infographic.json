  "key_insight": "DREX dynamically regroup s in-flight tokens/requests so that Early-Exit LLMs can exit some samples early without stalling the whole batch, preserving throughput while recovering the per-token latency and quality benefits of early exits.",
  "problem_solved": "Conventional batching assumes all requests in a batch progress synchronously, which prevents effective use of Early-Exit models — either wasting computation by holding fast examples, or lowering output quality by forcing premature exits.",
  "method": [
    "Run-time dynamic rebatching: continuously form new micro-batches from requests that are ready to proceed or exit, rather than treating the original batch as a fixed unit.",
    "Latency–quality-aware scheduler: decide when to rebatch vs. wait using a policy that trades small scheduling overheads for large computation savings and preserved output quality.",
    "Efficient execution primitives: token-level packing and async GPU execution to amortize rebatching overhead and keep hardware utilization high."

  "impact": "Practitioners can deploy Early-Exit LLMs with much better real-world latency and compute efficiency without sacrificing accuracy, enabling cost-effective, low-latency inference on production hardware.",
