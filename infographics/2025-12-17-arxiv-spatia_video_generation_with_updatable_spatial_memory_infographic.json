  "key_insight": "Spatia keeps a persistent 3D point-cloud as spatial memory and iteratively generates short video clips conditioned on — and updating — that memory via visual SLAM, yielding much better long-term spatial and temporal consistency.",
  "problem_solved": "Current video generators lose coherence over long sequences because they lack an explicit, updatable scene representation to preserve static geometry and align temporal dynamics.",

    "Maintain a persistent 3D scene point-cloud as spatial memory to represent static geometry.",
    "Generate video clips conditioned on the spatial memory with an explicit dynamic–static disentanglement.",

  "impact": "Enables more coherent, long-horizon video synthesis — useful for robotics, AR/VR, simulation, and any application needing consistent scene geometry across time. Decouples static scene representation from temporal dynamics to scale generation quality.",
