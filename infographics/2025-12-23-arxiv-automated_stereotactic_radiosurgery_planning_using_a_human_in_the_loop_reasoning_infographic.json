  "key_insight": "An LLM-based planning agent (SAGE) with human-in-the-loop chain-of-thought reasoning can feasibly automate stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) planning while providing interpretable, auditable decision traces that address black‑box concerns.",
  "problem_solved": "SRS planning requires highly precise dose shaping around critical brain structures, but opaque black‑box AI tools hinder clinical adoption due to lack of interpretability and clinician trust.",
  "method": [
    "Developed SAGE (Secure Agent for Generative Dose Expertise), an LLM-driven treatment‑planning agent with two variants (including a chain‑of‑thought enabled variant) to generate SRS plans.",
    "Integrated human‑in‑the‑loop review and audit trails to allow clinicians to inspect and override planning decisions.",
    "Retrospectively evaluated feasibility on a cohort of 41 brain metastasis patients treated with single‑fraction 18 Gy SRS to compare plan plausibility, safety checks, and interpretability."
  ],
  "impact": "Provides a practical pathway for integrating LLMs into high‑stakes clinical workflows by prioritizing explainability and clinician oversight; this can accelerate safe adoption of AI planning tools and guide future work on agentic medical AI.",
