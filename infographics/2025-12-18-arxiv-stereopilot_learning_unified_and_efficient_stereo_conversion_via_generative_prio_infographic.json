  "key_insight": "StereoPilot replaces the brittle multi-stage Depth→Warp→Inpaint pipeline with a single, unified model that leverages generative priors to synthesize consistent stereo pairs directly from a monocular input, handling depth ambiguity and format conversions in one step.",
  "problem_solved": "Automates high-quality monocular-to-stereo conversion while avoiding error propagation, depth ambiguity, and the need to separately handle parallel vs converged stereo formats inherent to traditional DWI pipelines.",
  "method": [
    "Train a unified, end-to-end model that conditions on a single RGB frame and a target stereo configuration to generate the matching stereo view(s) using learned generative priors.",
    "Incorporate disparity-aware losses and confidence/uncertainty modelling to resolve depth ambiguity and reduce artifacts without explicit multi-stage warping and inpainting.",
    "Design for efficiency via shared latent representations and lightweight refinement modules so the model produces high-quality stereo frames with low latency."
