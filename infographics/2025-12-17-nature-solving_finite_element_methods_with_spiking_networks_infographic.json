  "key_insight": "Spiking neural networks can be configured to solve finite element method (FEM) linear systems, reframing numerical simulation as event-driven neural dynamics. This enables a path to energy-efficient, brain-inspired solvers for engineering and scientific problems.",
  "problem_solved": "Conventional FEM solvers are computationally intensive and energy-hungry, especially at large scale; they also assume synchronous, floating-point computation. The paper addresses the need for scalable, low-energy solvers by mapping FEM computations to spiking/neuromorphic hardware.",
  "method": [
    "Encode FEM discretized equations and degrees of freedom into a spiking-network architecture where neuron states and synaptic interactions represent matrix coefficients and residuals.",
    "Use event-driven spiking dynamics and asynchronous updates to perform iterative solution (convergence emerges from spike timing and network interactions) rather than conventional dense numerical linear algebra.",
    "Leverage neuromorphic-friendly primitives (sparse events, local updates) to enable low-power execution and potential acceleration on neuromorphic processors or analog-in-memory devices."
