    "On-policy joint training: co-evolve a generator (reasoner) and an LLM-based discriminator in an adversarial RL loop so the reasoner learns to produce stepwise-valid chains-of-thought.",
    "Adversarial reward shaping: discriminator critiques intermediate steps and supplies fine-grained rewards/penalties to steer the reasoner away from invalid or shallow reasoning.",

  "impact": "Makes LLM reasoning more reliable and interpretable for tasks like math, code, and logical problem solving by improving stepwise correctness and reducing hallucinations. Offers practitioners a targeted RL-based fine-tuning method that prioritizes process quality over only endpoint metrics.",
