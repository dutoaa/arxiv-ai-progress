  "key_insight": "DREX dynamically regroup batches at inference time so tokens/requests that are ready to exit early do so without forcing the whole batch to wait or degrade quality — unlocking the efficiency of Early-Exit LLMs while preserving accuracy.",
  "problem_solved": "Traditional batching frameworks assume synchronous exits and either block EE opportunities or force premature exits, causing wasted compute, higher latency, or lower output quality for Early-Exit LLMs.",
  "method": [
    "Continuously monitor per-token/request exit readiness and extract exit candidates as they become available.",
    "Form new micro-batches for remaining layers by rebatching only the unfinished tokens/requests, using a low-overhead scheduler to balance throughput and latency.",
    "Integrate with existing hardware batching stacks to minimize reshuffling overhead while preserving model accuracy (no forced early terminations)."
  ],
  "impact": "DREX increases utilization and reduces end-to-end latency and compute cost for EE-enabled LLM inference, making real-world deployment of early-exit models more practical for latency-sensitive and cost-constrained services.",
