  "key_insight": "StereoPilot replaces brittle multi-stage Depth→Warp→Inpaint pipelines with a unified, generative-prior–driven model that directly synthesizes stereo views, reducing error propagation and handling different stereo formats in one framework.",
  "problem_solved": "Automatic monocular-to-stereo conversion suffers from cascading errors, depth ambiguity, and incompatibility between parallel and converged stereo formats; this paper addresses those limitations to produce higher-quality, consistent stereo videos efficiently.",
  "method": [
    "Train a single end-to-end model that leverages generative priors to infer plausible complementary views instead of relying on explicit depth estimation and sequential warping/inpainting.",
    "Enforce geometric and stereo-consistency losses and incorporate a lightweight format-adapter to handle both parallel and converged stereo configurations without separate pipelines.",
    "Optimize for efficiency (inference-time and parameter cost) so the method is practical for real-world video and VR/3D content pipelines."
