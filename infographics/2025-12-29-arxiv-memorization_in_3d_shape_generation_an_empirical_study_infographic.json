  "key_insight": "A quantitative evaluation framework reveals that 3D generative models can and do memorize training shapes under many common settings; memorization rises with limited data and high model capacity but is reducible via augmentation and regularization.",
  "problem_solved": "Provides the first systematic, measurable way to detect and quantify memorization in 3D shape generators, addressing risks of training-data leakage and lack of generative diversity.",
  "method": [
    "Design a memorization evaluation pipeline using 3D-aware similarity metrics (e.g., Chamfer Distance, EMD, IoU) and nearest-neighbor retrieval plus novelty/coverage statistics.",
    "Perform controlled experiments varying dataset size, model capacity/architecture, and training choices (augmentations, regularizers, objectives) to measure their effect on memorization.",
    "Combine quantitative thresholds with qualitative side-by-side comparisons to identify and categorize memorized vs. truly novel generated shapes."
  ],
  "impact": "Gives practitioners a practical toolkit to detect and mitigate data leakage in 3D generative pipelines and to tune models for better novelty–fidelity trade-offs, improving safety and generative diversity.",
