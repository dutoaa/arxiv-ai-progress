    "Perception-first pipeline — a video understanding module extracts semantic cues (gait, terrain, contact patterns, goal/intent) rather than only per-frame poses.",
    "Control module maps these high-level semantic descriptors to a physics-aware humanoid policy that performs stable locomotion through imitation learning and controller refinement.",
    "Integrated training and evaluation in simulated physics (with real video supervision) to close the understanding-to-control loop and reduce cascading errors from staged pipelines."
