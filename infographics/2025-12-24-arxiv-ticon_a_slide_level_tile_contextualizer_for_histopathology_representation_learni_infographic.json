  "key_insight": "TICON uses slide-level transformer attention to contextualize individual tile embeddings, producing rich, location-aware tile representations that capture both local morphology and global slide context in a single, reusable embedding.",
  "problem_solved": "Standard pipelines encode tiles independently, losing critical slide-level context required for accurate local (e.g., patch classification) and global (e.g., slide-level prognosis) tasks in histopathology. TICON fills this gap by re-infusing contextual information into tile features.",
  "method": [
    "Start with off-the-shelf tile encoders to extract per-tile features, then aggregate tiles from the same whole-slide image into a sequence.",
    "Apply a lightweight transformer-based contextualizer over the tile sequence to exchange information across spatially distributed tiles and produce contextualized tile embeddings.",
    "Output slide-aware tile representations that can be plugged into any downstream task (local patch models, slide-level classifiers, multiple-instance learning) without retraining the base encoder."
  ],
  "impact": "Provides practitioners a modular way to upgrade existing tile-based workflows with slide-aware features, improving interpretability and performance for both local and global pathology tasks while keeping compatibility with existing encoders and pipelines.",
