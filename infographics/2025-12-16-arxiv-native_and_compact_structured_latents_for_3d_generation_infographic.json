  "key_insight": "The paper introduces O-Voxel, a native sparse voxel structure that encodes geometry and appearance together to produce compact, structured latents—enabling generative models to represent complex topology and fine appearance detail more effectively.",
  "problem_solved": "Current 3D representations struggle with complex topologies and detailed appearance while being inefficient or non-native for generative modeling; this work provides a representation and latent structure designed to address those limitations.",
  "method": [
    "Design O-Voxel: an omni-voxel sparse 3D data structure that stores both geometry and appearance channels natively.",
    "Learn compact, structured latents directly from native 3D data using a training pipeline that maps O-Voxels to/from latent codes.",
    "Use the learned structured latents in a generative framework to synthesize high-fidelity 3D assets with complex topology and detailed appearance."

  "impact": "Provides AI/ML practitioners a more expressive and compact 3D representation for training generative models, improving fidelity, memory efficiency, and downstream tasks like synthesis, editing, and rendering.",
