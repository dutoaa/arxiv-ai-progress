  "key_insight": "A transcriptome-conditioned pipeline converts individual AML patient RNA-seq signatures into personalized de novo small-molecule candidates by combining co-expression-driven target selection with metaheuristic molecular assembly and target-driven filtering. This end-to-end approach links patient biology directly to generative drug design.",

    "Extract patient-specific actionable targets from bulk TCGA-LAML RNA-seq via weighted gene co-expression analysis (e.g., WGCNA) and differential expression to prioritize disease modules.",
    "Generate candidate molecules with a metaheuristic assembly engine (optimization-based de novo design guided by transcriptome-derived objectives) to explore chemical space efficiently.",
    "Apply target-driven filtering (in silico affinity prediction / scoring against prioritized targets plus ADMET and drug-likeness filters) to rank personalized leads."
