    "Geometry-aware diffusion outpainting: condition a diffusion model on sparse input views + camera poses to generate novel, view-consistent images.",
    "Multi-view geometric constraints: enforce depth/pose/epipolar consistency and multi-view losses to keep synthesized views physically plausible.",
    "Integration with reconstruction pipeline: augment inputs (or jointly optimize) for downstream MVS/NeRF-style 3D reconstruction to produce higher-fidelity geometry from few views."
