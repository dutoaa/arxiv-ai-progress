  "problem_solved": "Imitation learning policies trained on privileged expert demonstrations fail to generalize in closed-loop because experts have higher visibility and lower uncertainty than real sensor-based learners; the paper diagnoses this misalignment and shows how reducing it improves robustness.",

    "Systematically quantify sources of learner–expert asymmetry (e.g., visibility/occlusions, state uncertainty) and their impact on closed‑loop imitation performance.",
    "Introduce the LEAD strategy to reduce asymmetry by aligning expert demonstrations with student observations (e.g., restricting expert visibility and injecting realistic uncertainty/noise) during training.",
    "Evaluate the approach in simulation with closed‑loop metrics and ablations to demonstrate improved robustness over standard imitation baselines."

  "impact": "Practitioners training end‑to‑end driving agents in simulation can get markedly better real‑world style closed‑loop behavior by aligning expert data with the student’s sensory experience, reducing the need for excessive domain randomization or post‑hoc fine‑tuning.",
