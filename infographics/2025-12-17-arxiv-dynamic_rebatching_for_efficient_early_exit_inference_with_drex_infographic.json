  "key_insight": "Dynamic Rebatching (DREX) continually reshapes inference batches based on each token's early-exit readiness so tokens that can finish early do not wait for slower tokens, improving latency and throughput while preserving output quality.",
  "problem_solved": "Traditional batching for Early-Exit LLMs either forces a single batch decision (losing early-exit opportunities) or forces premature exits (hurting quality). This paper addresses inefficient resource use and increased latency when mixed-exit requests are processed together.",
  "method": [
    "Continuously track per-token/per-request exit readiness and decision signals during inference.",
    "Form and dispatch dynamic micro-batches that group tokens by exit stage, allowing ready tokens to exit immediately while others continue deeper layers.",
    "Lightweight scheduler integrates with the runtime to rebatch with minimal overhead, balancing GPU utilization and per-request quality constraints."
  ],
  "impact": "DREX enables faster, more cost-efficient LLM serving by unlocking early-exit benefits in real-world batched deployments without sacrificing accuracy—useful for latency-sensitive applications and large-scale model serving.",
