  "key_insight": "Spatia stores an explicit 3D point-cloud as persistent spatial memory and iteratively generates video clips conditioned on—and updates—that memory via visual SLAM, enabling much better long-term spatial and temporal consistency.",
  "problem_solved": "Existing video generation models lose geometric and temporal coherence over long sequences because they lack an updatable, persistent spatial representation of the scene.",

    "Maintain a persistent 3D scene point cloud as spatial memory to capture static geometry and scene layout.",

  "impact": "Enables generation of longer, more coherent videos with stable object positions and geometry, reducing hallucinations and drift; easily integrates with existing generative pipelines to improve temporal and spatial fidelity.",
