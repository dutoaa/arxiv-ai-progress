  "key_insight": "A parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy (scPEFT) lets pre-trained single-cell language models be adapted with only a small number of additional parameters, substantially improving generalization to unseen diseases, treatments and cell types.",
  "problem_solved": "Large single-cell language models are costly to fine-tune and often fail to generalize to novel biological conditions; scPEFT addresses limited data, compute, and poor out-of-distribution performance in single-cell applications.",
  "method": [
    "Introduce scPEFT: attach a small set of task-specific, trainable parameters to a frozen pre-trained single-cell LLM so the core model remains unchanged.",
    "Optimize only these lightweight modules (parameter-efficient updates) to adapt the model to new tasks or cohorts with limited data and compute.",
    "Evaluate transfer to novel diseases, treatments and cell types, showing improved performance while using far fewer trainable parameters than full fine-tuning."
