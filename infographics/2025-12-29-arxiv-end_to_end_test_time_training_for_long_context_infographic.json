  "key_insight": "Treat long-context language modeling as a continual learning problem: keep a standard sliding-window Transformer but continue learning at test time via next-token prediction to compress the observed context into model weights, with meta-learned initialization to enable fast adaptation.",
  "problem_solved": "Overcomes the limits of fixed-length context windows and ad-hoc architecture changes by enabling models to ingest and remember very long contexts through on-the-fly weight updates, improving coherence and retrieval across extended inputs.",

    "Use a standard Transformer with sliding-window attention as the backbone (no specialized long-context architecture).",
    "Perform test-time continual learning: run next-token prediction on the incoming context and update model weights to 'compress' context information into parameters.",
    "Meta-learn model initialization during training so the model is primed for fast, stable adaptation at test time (end-to-end test-time training pipeline)."
