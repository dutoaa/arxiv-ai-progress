  "key_insight": "Many failures on abstract reasoning benchmarks (e.g., ARC, ARC-AGI) are driven by a perception bottleneck—models struggle to parse visual inputs—not a lack of high-level reasoning. Fixing perception substantially narrows the gap attributed to reasoning deficits.",
  "problem_solved": "Clarifies whether low performance on 'fluid' reasoning benchmarks reflects reasoning weakness or upstream perceptual failures, and demonstrates that benchmark design can conflate perception with reasoning.",
  "method": [
    "Analyze model errors on ARC-style tasks to separate perceptual mistakes (object detection, attribute extraction, segmentation) from logical inference errors.",
    "Run controlled interventions: provide perfect or improved perceptual inputs (e.g., symbolic representations, corrected segmentations) and measure downstream reasoning performance.",
    "Ablation studies and metrics that quantify how much performance gains come from fixing perception vs improving reasoning."
  ],
  "impact": "Researchers and practitioners should re-evaluate benchmark interpretations and prioritize improving perception pipelines and dataset design; doing so leads to more accurate assessments of a model's true reasoning capacity.",
