  "key_insight": "Pretrained vision-language models can serve as reliable perceptual judges, predicting human binary preferences and enabling image compression models to be trained and evaluated in a human-aligned way.",
  "problem_solved": "Traditional distortion metrics (e.g., MSE, PSNR) do not align well with human perception and prior perceptual losses require large-scale psycho-visual labeling; this work provides an alternative judge that better matches human preference signals.",

    "Apply state-of-the-art vision-language models to compare reference vs. compressed images and produce pairwise preference or quality scores.",
    "Convert VLM-derived judgments into a training/evaluation signal (e.g., differentiable loss or ranking objective) to optimize compression models for human-aligned quality.",
    "Validate alignment by comparing VLM judgments against human preference data and standard distortion metrics on compression benchmarks."

  "impact": "Allows practitioners to train and evaluate compressors that prioritize perceived image quality with less reliance on bespoke human-label datasets, improving real-world visual fidelity and user satisfaction.",
