  "key_insight": "Introducing a variable window size (VWS) spatial smoothing compresses the coarray smoothing aperture and replaces perturbed rank‑one terms with unperturbed low‑rank contributions, improving signal/noise subspace separation and enabling more accurate DOA estimation from sparse arrays.",
  "problem_solved": "Sparse linear arrays and correlated sources produce rank‑deficient or noisy coarray covariance estimates that limit resolution and robustness of MUSIC/root‑MUSIC; the paper addresses insufficient smoothing aperture and perturbed outer‑product terms that degrade DOA performance.",

    "Construct coarray covariance from sparse linear array measurements and apply spatial smoothing with a variable window size to effectively compress the smoothing aperture.",
    "Replace certain perturbed rank‑one outer products in the smoothed coarray data with designed unperturbed low‑rank terms to boost separation between signal and noise subspaces.",
