  "key_insight": "MAI-UI introduces a family of foundation GUI agents across model scales (2B → 235B-A22B) and a deployment‑oriented design that closes the gap between research prototypes and real‑world GUI agent usage, prioritizing native user interaction and robustness.",
  "problem_solved": "Addresses four practical barriers to realistic GUI agent deployment: lack of native agent–user interaction, the limitations of UI‑only operation, absence of a practical deployment architecture, and brittleness in dynamic real‑world environments.",
  "method": [
    "Provide a spectrum of foundation GUI agent sizes (2B, 8B, 32B, 235B‑A22B) to match different compute and capability tradeoffs.",
    "Design for real‑world centricity: enable native agent–user interaction and extend beyond UI‑only control (multi‑modal inputs/outputs and environment awareness).",
    "Propose a practical deployment architecture plus robustness mechanisms (monitoring, adaptation, and environment‑aware strategies) to reduce brittleness in dynamic settings."

  "impact": "Enables AI/ML practitioners to choose appropriately sized GUI agents and deploy them in production with improved interaction fidelity and resilience, accelerating real‑world HCI applications and reducing integration friction.",
