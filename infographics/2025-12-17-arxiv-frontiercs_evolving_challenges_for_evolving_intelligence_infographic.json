  "key_insight": "FrontierCS is a curated benchmark of 156 expert-designed, open-ended computer science problems where optimal solutions are unknown but programmatic solutions can be objectively evaluated—shifting evaluation from correctness of fixed answers to measurable solution quality.",
  "problem_solved": "Existing benchmarks emphasize tasks with known optimal solutions and fixed answers, failing to test models on creative, ambiguous, or research-like CS challenges that require program synthesis, iterative improvement, and trade-off reasoning.",
  "method": [
    "Assemble 156 diverse, open-ended CS problems reviewed by CS PhDs and top competitive programmers/problem setters.",
    "Require models to produce executable programs; evaluate outputs with objective, quantitative metrics (performance, correctness, resource use, heuristics) rather than single ground-truth answers.",
    "Provide a benchmark pipeline for automated execution, scoring, and comparative evaluation to measure solution quality and enable iterative improvements."
  ],
  "impact": "FrontierCS enables evaluation of AI systems on realistic, creative problem-solving in computer science, encouraging progress in program generation, empirical optimization, and emergent reasoning beyond fixed-answer benchmarks.",
