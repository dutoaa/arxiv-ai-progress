  "key_insight": "Co-training an LLM reasoner and an LLM-based discriminator via on-policy adversarial reinforcement learning produces more accurate, self-critiquing multi-step reasoning, substantially reducing process errors like incorrect calculations and brittle logic.",
  "problem_solved": "Addresses persistent process-level failures in chain-of-thought reasoning (miscomputations, superficially plausible but invalid steps, and brittle logical chains) by providing a learned adversarial critic that rewards correct, verifiable reasoning steps.",
  "method": [
    "On-policy joint training: co-evolve a generative LLM (reasoner) and a discriminative LLM (critic) in an adversarial RL loop where the reasoner aims to 'fool' the discriminator with correct reasoning.",
    "LLM-based discriminator supplies fine-grained, step-level reward signals and identifies invalid or low-quality steps to guide the reasoner toward robust, verifiable chains-of-thought.",
    "Compute-efficient review schedule: selectively evaluate or re-evaluate reasoning steps to reduce compute while preserving training signal quality (scalable review/verification budget)."

  "impact": "Improves the reliability and correctness of LLM multi-step reasoning, making models better suited for math, scientific, and decision-critical tasks where process validity matters; offers a scalable pathway to incorporate learned self-critique into deployed systems.",
