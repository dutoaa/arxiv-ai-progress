  "key_insight": "A meta-learning-based controller embedded in O-RAN can quickly adapt handover policies per cell and user, striking a practical balance between Traditional Handovers (THOs) and Conditional Handovers (CHOs) to reduce failures and delays across large, heterogeneous NextG deployments.",
  "problem_solved": "Mitigates high HO failure rates, latency, and inefficient signaling/resource use in dense and high-frequency mobile networks by automatically selecting and adapting THO vs CHO strategies to local mobility and radio conditions.",
  "method": [
    "Meta-learning framework: meta-train across many cells/areas so the model learns transferable HO strategy priors.",
    "Fast online adaptation: fine-tune the prior with a few local samples to optimize per-cell/user HO decisions (THO vs CHO) under current conditions.",
    "O-RAN integration: implement as a near-RT RIC xApp for real-time decisioning that balances reliability, signaling overhead, and resource reservation."

  "impact": "Demonstrates how meta-learning enables rapid adaptation in non-stationary, heterogeneous telecom environments, reducing data needs and deployment latency — a practical pattern AI/ML practitioners can apply to other edge-network control problems.",
