  "key_insight": "Incorporate visual context directly into the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning process so the model's intermediate thinking attends to images as well as text, producing multi-modal outputs that preserve key visual features and references.",
  "problem_solved": "Current CoT-based unified models optimize for textual coherence but neglect visual-context consistency during multi-modal generation (especially multi-reference cases), causing outputs that contradict or ignore important visual details.",
  "method": [
    "Introduce a visual-aware CoT pipeline that fuses image features into each reasoning step so intermediate tokens are grounded in visual evidence.",
    "Enforce alignment between CoT steps and image regions via cross-attention grounding and visual-consistency losses (e.g., region-token alignment and contrastive/objective terms).",
    "Train on multi-reference multi-modal data and apply decoding constraints that preserve explicit visual attributes across generated outputs."

  "impact": "Improves fidelity and trustworthiness of multimodal generation—useful for VQA, image editing, multi-image captioning and any application requiring faithful reference to visual inputs, reducing hallucinations and preserving critical visual details.",
