  "key_insight": "MemFlow introduces an adaptive, flowing memory mechanism that dynamically selects and compresses different historical cues for each upcoming video chunk, enabling consistent long-range video narratives without fixed, lossy summarization strategies.",
  "problem_solved": "Maintains content consistency across long streaming video generation by overcoming rigid, predefined memory-compression strategies that fail to provide the right historical cues for different to-be-generated segments.",
  "method": [
    "Adaptive memory selection: before generating each new chunk, MemFlow identifies which historical frames or cues are most relevant and prioritizes them rather than applying a single global compression.",
    "Flowing memory update: memory is updated as a dynamic stream (flow) so information useful for future chunks is retained or refined, enabling targeted retention of salient narrative elements.",
    "Efficient representation: uses compact, task-aware memory encodings (e.g., learned tokens or selective features) to keep computation and storage low while preserving long-range consistency."

  "impact": "Enables more coherent and scalable streaming video generation—practical for long-form video synthesis, real-time narrative continuations, and memory-constrained deployment—by improving consistency without large memory or compute overhead.",
