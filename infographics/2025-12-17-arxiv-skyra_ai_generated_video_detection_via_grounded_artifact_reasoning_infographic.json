  "key_insight": "Skyra is a specialized multimodal large language model that detects AI-generated videos by identifying human-perceivable visual artifacts and using them as grounded, human-interpretable evidence, moving beyond simple binary labels.",
  "problem_solved": "Most existing AI-video detectors only output binary judgments and offer no human-understandable rationale; Skyra addresses the need for reliable, explainable detection that provides concrete visual evidence.",
  "method": [
    "Specialize an MLLM to analyze video frames and short temporal windows for human-perceivable artifacts (e.g., texture inconsistencies, temporal flicker, geometry or lighting anomalies).",
    "Ground detection in concrete artifacts by producing annotated evidence (frames, timestamps, artifact labels) plus natural-language explanations that justify the decision.",
    "Combine visual feature extraction with language reasoning to produce multimodal outputs usable for forensic inspection and human verification."
  ],
  "impact": "Skyra enables practitioners, analysts, and regulators to not only flag suspected AI-generated videos but to inspect and trust the rationale via concrete artifact evidence—improving auditability, triage, and downstream forensic workflows.",
  "visual_elements": [
    "Pipeline diagram: video input → frame/temporal extractor → artifact detector → explanation generator.",
    "Side-by-side example frames: original vs. AI-generated with highlighted artifact regions (e.g., inconsistent eyes, warped edges, flicker).",
    "Timeline bar: timestamps with artifact severity markers and clickable evidence cards.",
    "Example explanation card: annotated frame + concise natural-language rationale and artifact labels."
