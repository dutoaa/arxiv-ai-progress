  "key_insight": "DREX (Dynamic Rebatching) reorganizes in-flight requests at runtime so tokens that are ready to exit continue without forcing the whole batch to wait — preserving batching efficiency while avoiding premature exits and quality loss.",
  "problem_solved": "Traditional batching for Early-Exit LLMs either stalls throughput (waiting for slow tokens) or degrades quality (forcing early exits). The paper solves the mismatch between variable token exit times and fixed batching policies to regain latency and compute efficiency without hurting output quality.",
  "method": [
    "Run-time scheduler that tracks per-request/per-token exit readiness and selectively groups (rebatches) only the work that must proceed to deeper layers.",
    "Adaptive policies (thresholds/timeouts) to balance waiting vs. dispatching, avoiding premature exits while maximizing hardware utilization.",
    "Integration-friendly design that fits into existing batching stacks and preserves model accuracy by making exit decisions individual rather than batch-uniform."
  ],
  "impact": "Makes Early-Exit LLM inference both faster and more cost-effective by recovering batching benefits without sacrificing accuracy, enabling lower-latency and lower-cost serving for production LLMs.",

    "Pipeline timeline: tokens in a batch with some exiting early and others rebatching to deeper layers (animated/split flow).",
