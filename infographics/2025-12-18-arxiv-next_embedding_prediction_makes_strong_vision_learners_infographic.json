  "key_insight": "Training vision models to predict future patch embeddings (next-embedding prediction) rather than only learning static representations produces strong self-supervised visual learners. Using causal masking and stop-gradient stabilizes this generative-style objective and lets the model learn to perform predictive tasks directly.",
  "problem_solved": "Addresses limits of conventional self-supervised vision methods that focus on producing reusable features; instead it closes the gap between representation learning and predictive model learning by teaching models to generate task-relevant embeddings directly.",
  "method": [
    "Predict future patch embeddings conditioned on past patch embeddings using causal (autoregressive) masking over patch sequences.",
    "Use embedding-space targets (not raw pixels) and apply stop-gradient on targets to stabilize training and avoid collapse.",
    "Train a model to generate embeddings directly—shifting the objective from learning features for downstream use to learning a predictive model that outputs embeddings suitable for tasks."
  ],
  "impact": "This approach offers a simple, scalable pretraining objective that yields stronger, more adaptable vision learners and can simplify transfer to downstream tasks by producing task-ready embeddings. It brings generative pretraining benefits from NLP into computer vision, enabling models that better anticipate future visual semantics.",
