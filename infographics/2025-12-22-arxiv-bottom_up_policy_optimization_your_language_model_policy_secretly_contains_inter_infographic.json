  "key_insight": "Large language models implicitly contain many internal sub-policies distributed across the Transformer residual stream and layers; by decomposing the model bottom-up, you can identify and optimize these internal policies separately for more targeted and interpretable policy improvement.",
  "problem_solved": "Standard RL treats an LLM as a single unified policy, which hides layer/module-level decision structure and leads to coarse, inefficient, and opaque policy updates; this work exposes and leverages internal policies for finer-grained optimization.",
  "method": [
    "Decompose the global policy by exploiting the intrinsic split of the Transformer residual stream and the equivalence of composing hidden states to isolate layer/module-level internal policies.",
    "Reconstruct per-layer/module policy components and measure their contributions to token-action choices.",
    "Apply a bottom-up optimization procedure: optimize lower-level internal policies first, then propagate improvements upward to produce targeted global policy updates."

  "impact": "Provides practitioners a pathway to more sample-efficient, interpretable, and modular policy optimization for LLMs—enabling targeted fine-tuning, safer interventions, and clearer reasoning diagnostics without treating the model as an indivisible black box.",
