    "Formulate the attack as a ray-direction optimization: for each candidate direction, perform a line search to find the smallest ℓ2 perturbation that flips the top-1 label.",
    "Introduce momentum (Nesterov-inspired) updates on the ray direction (ARS-OPT) to accelerate directional convergence and avoid slow zig-zagging in the search space.",
    "Combine momentum-driven direction updates with query-efficient line-search steps so fewer label queries are required per optimization iteration."

  "impact": "Enables much more query-efficient evaluation of model robustness under hard-label constraints, making black-box attack experiments faster and more practical for both attackers and defenders assessing worst-case behavior.",
