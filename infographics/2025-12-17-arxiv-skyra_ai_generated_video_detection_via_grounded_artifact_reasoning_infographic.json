    "Specialized multimodal LLM that ingests video frames and temporal context to generate artifact descriptions and a detection verdict.",
    "Artifact-centric pipeline: frame-level artifact detectors + temporal consistency checks feed the MLLM, which reasons and grounds its decision with example frames and timestamps.",
    "Trained/fine-tuned on paired real/synthetic videos and human-annotated artifact labels to align model outputs with human-perceivable evidence."
