  "key_insight": "eMOSAIC combines multimodal data with per-sample out-of-distribution (OOD) uncertainty estimates to markedly improve binding affinity prediction for compounds that act on multiple targets (polypharmacology). It not only predicts affinities but also flags when predictions are unreliable.",
  "problem_solved": "Accurate affinity prediction for compounds with multiple protein targets is hampered by heterogeneous data and out-of-distribution samples; practitioners need trustworthy, per-instance confidence to prioritize candidates and avoid misleading predictions.",
  "method": [
    "Integrates multimodal inputs (e.g., chemical and protein representations plus experimental/biophysical features) into a unified prediction model.",
    "Quantifies individual sample uncertainty and identifies OOD cases so predictions can be calibrated or withheld when unreliable.",
    "Optimizes binding-affinity prediction specifically for polypharmacology by leveraging uncertainty-informed decision rules during scoring and prioritization."
  ],
  "impact": "Provides AI/ML practitioners a practical way to produce more reliable, interpretable affinity scores for multi-target drug candidates, improving prioritization in lead discovery and reducing costly experimental follow-ups.",
