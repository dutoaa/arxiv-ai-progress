  "key_insight": "The paper exposes a significant gap in spatial reasoning of MLLMs by moving evaluation beyond controlled indoor scenes to large-scale outdoor (open-world) scenarios with verifiable metric ground truth.",
  "problem_solved": "Existing benchmarks either simplify spatial tasks or are restricted to indoor domains, failing to diagnose how well MLLMs handle metric, large-scale, real-world spatial reasoning.",
  "method": [
    "Construct a large-scale benchmark that includes outdoor/open-world scenes with verifiable metric ground truth and diverse spatial tasks (e.g., distance, orientation, localization).",
    "Design evaluation protocols and metrics that measure metric accuracy, robustness across scales, and generalization from indoor to outdoor environments.",
    "Systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs on the new benchmark to quantify the spatial reasoning gap and identify specific failure modes."
