  "key_insight": "FrontierCS introduces a benchmark of 156 expert-designed, open-ended computer science problems that require models to produce executable programs and are evaluated by objective, run-time metrics rather than known optimal answers. This shifts evaluation from closed-form tasks to research-like, creatively open problems that better probe evolving intelligence.",
  "problem_solved": "Existing benchmarks emphasize tasks with known solutions or fixed answer spaces, which under-represent the open-ended, creative problem-solving needed in real-world CS; FrontierCS fills this gap by providing objectively evaluable problems whose optimal solutions are unknown.",
  "method": [
    "Curate 156 diverse CS problems (algorithms, systems, theory, ML, security, etc.) designed and reviewed by CS PhDs and top competitive problem setters.",
    "Require models to submit executable programs; use automated test harnesses and objective metrics (correctness, performance, resource usage, robustness) to evaluate solution quality.",
    "Emphasize open-endedness: problems allow multiple valid approaches and incremental improvement, enabling nuanced ranking and analysis of model capabilities."
  ],
  "impact": "FrontierCS provides a practical, expert-vetted benchmark that drives development and evaluation of models capable of creative, executable problem solving, informing advances in program synthesis, reasoning, and real-world software competence.",
