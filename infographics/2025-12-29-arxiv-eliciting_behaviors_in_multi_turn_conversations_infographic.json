  "key_insight": "The paper extends behavior elicitation from single-turn prompts to multi-turn conversations by introducing an analytical framework that categorizes existing elicitation methods into three families and clarifies how conversational context changes model behaviors.",
  "problem_solved": "Addresses the challenge of reliably inducing and evaluating specific, often complex behaviors from large language models within multi-turn dialogues—where prompt history and turn structure alter elicitation effectiveness and are not captured by single-turn studies.",
  "method": [
    "Develop an analytical framework that organizes existing elicitation techniques into three families (taxonomy) to clarify their assumptions and mechanisms.",
    "Systematically analyze how multi-turn context and turn dynamics affect the success of behavior elicitation across models and behaviors.",
    "Use the framework to identify gaps, comparative strengths of methods, and practical diagnostics or guidelines for constructing multi-turn prompts and evaluations."

  "impact": "Provides researchers and practitioners a principled way to design, compare, and evaluate prompt-based interventions in conversational settings—improving robustness of testing, alignment, and control for deployed dialogue agents.",
