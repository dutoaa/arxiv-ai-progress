    "Nested/hierarchical agent design: a high-level planner issues goals, mid-level modules choose browsing subgoals, and low-level controllers emit DOM-level actions.",
    "Intermediate compression and abstraction: summarize or extract salient page content into compact observations to reduce bandwidth and decision noise for the policy.",
    "Tool and training wrappers: present browser capabilities as structured, learnable primitives (click, scroll, extract, follow link) and train via imitation/agentic learning to coordinate nested modules."

  "impact": "Enables agents to leverage the full richness of real browsing for deeper, multi-step information tasks while remaining robust and efficient; practical for building stronger web-capable assistants and search agents.",
