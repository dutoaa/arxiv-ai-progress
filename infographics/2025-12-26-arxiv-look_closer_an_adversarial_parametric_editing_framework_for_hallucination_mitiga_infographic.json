    "Adversarial parametric editing: learn compact parameter edits to the VLM that reduce hallucination risk under adversarial prompts or inputs.",
    "Alignment objective: train edits to increase visual grounding (contrastive/attention-based losses) while penalizing language-prior-driven, visually inconsistent generations.",
    "Lightweight, targeted updates: apply and evaluate small, controllable parameter deltas so the model retains overall capabilities while mitigating hallucinations."
