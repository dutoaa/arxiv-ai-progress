  "key_insight": "Introducing structured 'rubric rewards' to train language models produces research plans that better satisfy explicit constraints and implicit requirements, improving reliability of AI co‑scientists in planning tasks.",
  "problem_solved": "Language models often generate research plans that ignore constraints or miss implicit requirements; this work addresses how to teach models to produce constraint‑compliant, high‑quality plans suitable for researcher use or implementation.",
  "method": [
    "Design explicit rubrics that decompose desirable plan qualities (constraint adherence, feasibility, novelty, clarity) into measurable criteria.",
    "Convert rubric scores into reward signals and use reward‑aware training (e.g., reward modeling + policy fine‑tuning / RLHF style updates) to bias the model toward rubric‑aligned outputs.",
    "Evaluate with human raters and automatic metrics on constraint adherence, plan quality, and downstream implementability."
  ],
  "impact": "Rubric rewards make AI co‑scientists more dependable collaborators by aligning plan generation with researcher expectations and constraints, reducing manual post‑editing and improving adoption in research workflows.",
