  "key_insight": "This paper extends behavior elicitation techniques from single-turn prompts to realistic multi-turn conversations and introduces an analytical framework that categorizes existing methods into three families, revealing how conversational context changes what prompts elicit. It shows that multi-turn dynamics materially affect the success and design of elicitation strategies.",
  "problem_solved": "How to identify and reliably induce specific, often complex behaviors from large language models in multi-turn conversational settings—where single-turn prompting techniques fall short.",
  "method": [
    "Propose an analytical framework that organizes existing elicitation methods into three families (classification, comparison, and iterative/conversational strategies) to clarify their assumptions and failure modes in multi-turn contexts.",
    "Adapt and apply existing prompting and search techniques to multi-turn dialogues, investigating how conversation history, turn ordering, and scaffolding influence behavior elicitation.",
    "Empirically evaluate these approaches (benchmarks/metrics and controlled experiments) to derive practical guidelines for eliciting behaviors across multiple turns."

  "impact": "Provides practitioners with a clearer taxonomy and tested practices for eliciting and evaluating model behaviors in realistic chat settings, improving robustness, evaluation fidelity, and safety of deployed conversational AI. It enables better prompt design, benchmark development, and risk assessment for multi-turn interactions.",
