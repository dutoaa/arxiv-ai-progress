  "key_insight": "State-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) can act as reliable perceptual judges, replicating binary human preferences for image quality and enabling compression models to be optimized for human-aligned perception instead of naive pixel-wise losses.",
  "problem_solved": "Traditional distortion metrics (e.g., MSE) and bespoke perceptual nets are poorly aligned with human judgments and/or require costly psychophysical datasets; the paper addresses the need for scalable, accurate perceptual evaluation and optimization for image compression.",
  "method": [
    "Use pretrained VLMs to produce perceptual judgments (e.g., pairwise preference scores or embedding distances) that correlate with human binary comparisons.",
    "Incorporate the VLM-derived judge as a loss or evaluation metric to guide training/selection of compression models toward outputs preferred by humans.",
    "Validate agreement with human studies and demonstrate improved visual quality (according to human judgments) at matched bitrates versus MSE-optimized baselines."

  "impact": "Provides a scalable, off-the-shelf route to make compression architectures human-aligned without massive psychophysical data collection, enabling practitioners to optimize for perceived quality rather than pixel error.",
