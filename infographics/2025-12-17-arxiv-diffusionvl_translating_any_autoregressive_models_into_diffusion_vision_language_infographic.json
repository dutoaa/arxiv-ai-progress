  "key_insight": "A lightweight \"translation\" framework lets you repurpose any pretrained autoregressive (AR) language model as the language backbone of a diffusion-based vision–language model (dVLM), combining AR language strengths with diffusion decoding advantages.",
  "problem_solved": "Diffusion VLMs underperform compared with AR-based VLMs because base diffusion language models lack the capabilities of large AR models; this work removes that barrier by enabling direct conversion of AR models into powerful diffusion VLMs.",
  "method": [
    "Introduce a translation module that maps AR model outputs (token distributions/representations) into the conditioning space used by diffusion denoisers, enabling joint multimodal generation without training a diffusion LM from scratch.",
    "Train via teacher–student style alignment and cross-modal loss terms so the diffusion model learns to match the AR model's language behavior while preserving diffusion’s stochastic decoding benefits.",
    "Design plug-and-play adapters/efficient fine-tuning so existing pretrained AR models can be converted with minimal additional parameters and compute."

  "impact": "Makes diffusion-based vision–language models practical by leveraging mature AR LMs — improving controllability, diversity, and capability of multimodal generation while reducing the need for full diffusion-language pretraining.",
