  "key_insight": "VA-π introduces a lightweight post-training variational alignment that directly optimizes autoregressive token generators using pixel-space feedback, closing the gap between token-likelihood training and image reconstruction quality.",
  "problem_solved": "Autoregressive visual generators are trained to maximize token likelihood while tokenizers are trained to reconstruct pixels, causing a misalignment that yields token sequences decoding into low-quality images without pixel-level supervision.",
  "method": [
    "Post-training variational policy alignment: treat the AR generator as a policy and align it to the tokenizer+decoder using a principled variational objective in pixel space.",
    "Monte Carlo / sampling-based evaluation of decoded pixels from generated token sequences, computing a pixel-level loss (or evidence lower bound) and backpropagating updates to the AR model via a policy-gradient or reweighted likelihood estimator.",
    "Lightweight plug-in design compatible with existing tokenizers and decoders — no need to retrain tokenizer, enabling practical improvements to generation quality after model training."

  "impact": "Provides a practical technique to improve image fidelity of autoregressive generators with minimal compute and engineering overhead, enabling practitioners to reduce decoding artifacts and better align token-level models with pixel-level goals.",
