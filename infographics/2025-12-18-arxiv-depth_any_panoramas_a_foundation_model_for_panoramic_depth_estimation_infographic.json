  "key_insight": "A panoramic metric depth foundation model trained on a large, mixed dataset (public + synthetic UE5 + text-to-image + web panoramas) with a three-stage pseudo-labeling/data-in-the-loop strategy achieves robust, metric depth estimation across diverse scene distances and domains.",
  "problem_solved": "Existing depth models struggle to produce accurate, metric depth for full 360° panoramas across both near and far scene distances and suffer from domain gaps between indoor/outdoor and synthetic/real data.",
