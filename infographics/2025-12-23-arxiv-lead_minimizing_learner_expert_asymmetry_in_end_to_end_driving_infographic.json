  "key_insight": "Reducing the information gap between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-only student observations (visibility and uncertainty differences) substantially improves closed-loop imitation performance in simulated end-to-end driving.",
  "problem_solved": "Imitation-learned driving policies trained on privileged expert data fail in closed-loop because experts see and know more (ignore occlusions, have low uncertainty) than student agents that rely on raw sensors, causing a learner–expert asymmetry and poor real-world robustness.",

    "Quantify and analyze the visibility and uncertainty gaps between privileged experts and sensor-based students in simulation.",
    "Minimize learner–expert asymmetry by aligning expert demonstrations to student inputs—e.g., introducing occlusions/noise and stochasticity to expert signals and using uncertainty-aware training objectives.",
    "Evaluate aligned training in closed-loop driving scenarios to show improved robustness compared to standard imitation baselines."

  "impact": "Provides a practical recipe for making simulator-generated expert data more useful for sensor-based end-to-end driving policies—leading to more reliable closed-loop behavior and faster transfer from simulation to realistic deployment.",
