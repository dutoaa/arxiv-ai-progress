  "key_insight": "Explicit, quantitative rubrics can be turned into reward signals to fine-tune LLMs so they produce research plans that better satisfy constraints and implicit quality requirements.",
  "problem_solved": "Language models often generate research plans that miss constraints, lack feasibility, or ignore implicit evaluation criteria; this work addresses how to train models to follow multi-criteria standards for usable scientific planning.",
  "method": [
    "Design task-specific rubrics that decompose plan quality into measurable dimensions (e.g., feasibility, novelty, resource constraints, clarity).",
    "Train reward models to predict rubric scores and use those rewards to fine-tune a base LLM (e.g., via reward-weighted fine-tuning / RL-style optimization) so outputs optimize for rubric-aligned quality.",
    "Evaluate with automated rubric scoring plus human expert review and iterate on rubric definitions to close gaps between model behavior and researcher expectations."

  "impact": "Rubric-based rewards make AI co-scientists produce more constraint-compliant, implementable plans, improving trust and usefulness for researchers and enabling broader application of LLMs to structured, safety-sensitive scientific tasks.",
