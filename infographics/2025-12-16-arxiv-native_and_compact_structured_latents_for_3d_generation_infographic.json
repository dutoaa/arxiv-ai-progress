    "Define O‑Voxel: an omni‑voxel sparse 3D structure that stores both geometric and appearance signals at voxel locations.",
    "Learn compact structured latents from native 3D data by mapping into the O‑Voxel space so downstream generative models operate on a dense-yet-sparse, semantically meaningful latent.",
    "Use the O‑Voxel latent as the core representation for 3D generation and reconstruction tasks, reducing memory and improving fidelity for complex assets."
