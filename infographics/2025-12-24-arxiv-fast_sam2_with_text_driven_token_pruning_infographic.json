  "key_insight": "Use the text prompt (object description) to score and prune irrelevant visual tokens before temporal reasoning, so SAM2 only processes a compact, task-relevant token set — drastically cutting compute and memory with minimal accuracy loss.",
  "problem_solved": "SAM2 processes dense visual tokens across time for prompt-driven video/object segmentation, causing high compute and memory costs and poor scalability; the paper reduces wasted computation by removing tokens that are not relevant to the text-guided target.",
