  "key_insight": "GriDiT factorizes long image-sequence generation into a grid of localized diffusion processes with lightweight cross-grid conditioning, drastically reducing compute and memory while preserving global temporal/spatial coherence.",
  "problem_solved": "Current methods treat long image sequences as huge stacked tensors, leading to poor scalability, high memory use, and slow sampling; GriDiT addresses efficient, scalable generative modeling for very long image sequences.",
  "method": [
    "Partition the spatio-temporal volume into a grid of local cells and run factorized diffusion processes per cell instead of operating on a single giant tensor.",
    "Exchange compact cross-cell conditioning signals (e.g., sparse attention or conditioning channels) to maintain global consistency across the grid.",
    "Use hierarchical/progressive sampling across grid levels or time windows to enable linear scaling in compute and faster inference for long sequences."
