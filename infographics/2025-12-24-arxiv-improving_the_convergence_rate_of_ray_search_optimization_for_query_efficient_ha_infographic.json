  "problem_solved": "Hard-label black‑box attacks require prohibitively many queries because only the top-1 label is available and finding the minimal perturbation direction (ray) is slow; this work reduces query complexity by improving the ray-search optimizer.",

    "Introduce ARS-OPT: a momentum-based update on ray directions inspired by Nesterov’s Accelerated Gradient to speed directional search.",
    "Combine the momentum updates with a query-efficient line/step search along each ray to find the minimal ℓ2 perturbation that crosses the decision boundary.",
    "Provide theoretical analysis showing an improved convergence rate over vanilla ray-search and validate empirically with reduced queries and higher attack efficiency."
  ],
  "impact": "Significantly fewer queries make hard-label attacks more practical for evaluating model robustness and for developing defenses; practitioners get a faster, theoretically grounded tool for black‑box robustness assessment.",
