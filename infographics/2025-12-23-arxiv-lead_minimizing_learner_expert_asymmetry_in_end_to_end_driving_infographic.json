  "key_insight": "Performance loss in end-to-end driving often comes from a mismatch between privileged expert demonstrations and noisy, occluded sensor inputs available to student policies; reducing this learner–expert asymmetry significantly improves closed-loop robustness.",
  "problem_solved": "Addresses the gap where imitation-learned driving policies perform well in open-loop evaluation but fail in closed-loop because experts see cleaner, more certain information than the sensor-based student.",
  "method": [
    "Quantify and analyze the asymmetry between privileged expert observations and sensor-based learner inputs (visibility, occlusions, uncertainty).",
    "Introduce practical mitigation strategies to close the gap (e.g., degrade or mask expert inputs to match sensors, augment learner observations, and incorporate uncertainty-aware training/losses).",
    "Empirically validate that minimizing this asymmetry yields more robust closed-loop driving in simulation benchmarks."

  "impact": "Makes imitation learning for autonomous driving more reliable by aligning training signals with real sensor conditions — reducing sim-to-real fragility and improving safety and deployability of learned controllers.",
