  "key_insight": "Combining explicit motion/geometry priors with learned attention for cross-frame alignment yields more reliable spatio-temporal correspondence in end-to-end 3D perception than attention-only schemes.",
  "problem_solved": "Existing E2E 3D perception models rely heavily on attention and simplified unified motion assumptions, which struggle to align objects across frames under complex motion, occlusion, and varying viewpoints—hindering temporal modeling and downstream tasks like tracking and forecasting.",
  "method": [
    "Spatio-temporal alignment module that fuses explicit motion/geometry priors (ego-motion compensation, per-object or per-voxel motion hypotheses) with cross-frame attention to produce robust correspondences.",
    "Multi-scale geometric-aware feature propagation: project features into 3D or bird's-eye coordinates, apply motion-aware warping, then refine with attention-based matching to capture both structural and semantic cues.",
    "Temporal consistency and pose-aware losses during training to enforce alignment quality and reduce drift across frames."

  "impact": "Provides a practical design pattern for AD perception systems: integrate explicit physical/geomtric motion modeling with attention to improve temporal robustness, easier debugging, and better performance on motion-sensitive 3D tasks without relying solely on implicit semantic alignment.",
