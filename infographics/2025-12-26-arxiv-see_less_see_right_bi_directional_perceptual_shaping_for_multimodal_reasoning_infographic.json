  "key_insight": "BiPS converts question-conditioned masked views into bidirectional \"where-to-look\" signals that jointly steer perception and reasoning, letting VLMs attend to fine-grained visual evidence (e.g., chart polylines) more accurately and efficiently.",
  "problem_solved": "Existing VLM intermediate cues miss fine-grained visual evidence, generalize poorly across domains, and add high inference-time cost; BiPS addresses focused visual grounding and efficiency for multimodal reasoning.",
  "method": [
    "Generate question-conditioned masked views that hide irrelevant pixels while preserving task-relevant fine-grained features.",
    "Derive bidirectional perceptual signals (perception→reasoning and reasoning→perception) that guide attention to precise visual evidence during reasoning.",
    "Integrate these signals into VLMs as a lightweight module/latent tokens to improve accuracy on visual reasoning tasks and reduce inference computation."

  "impact": "Practitioners gain more accurate and interpretable multimodal reasoning with lower inference cost and better cross-domain generalization—particularly valuable for chart/diagram understanding and other fine-grained vision-language tasks.",
