  "key_insight": "VA-π introduces a lightweight post-training variational objective that aligns autoregressive token policies with pixel-space reconstructions, reducing the mismatch between token-likelihood optimization and final image quality.",
  "problem_solved": "Addresses the misalignment between tokenizers (trained to reconstruct clean images) and autoregressive generators (trained only on token likelihood), which leads to token sequences that decode into low-quality or artifact-prone images without pixel-level supervision.",
  "method": [
    "Formulate a variational policy alignment objective that links the AR token policy to the tokenizer's pixel-space decoder, enabling direct pixel-aware optimization of generation.",
    "Post-train the AR generator (no tokenizer retraining) by sampling decoded images, computing pixel-level (or perceptual) feedback, and updating the token policy via the variational objective.",
    "Keep the procedure lightweight and plug-in: preserves existing tokenizers and likelihood-based training while reducing reconstruction artifacts through targeted fine-tuning."

  "impact": "Provides a practical, low-cost way to improve visual fidelity of autoregressive image models by directly aligning token generation with pixel outcomes—useful for practitioners deploying AR-based image synthesis who want better decoded image quality without retraining tokenizers.",
