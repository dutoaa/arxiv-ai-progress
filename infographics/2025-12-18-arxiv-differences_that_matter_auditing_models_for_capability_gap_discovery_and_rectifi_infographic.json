  "key_insight": "AuditDM trains an MLLM as an automated auditor that actively crafts challenging questions and counterfactual images to surface where multimodal models disagree, enabling systematic discovery and targeted repair of capability gaps.",
  "problem_solved": "Conventional MLLM evaluations are opaque and miss important, model-specific failure modes; AuditDM addresses the need for interpretable, automated discovery of meaningful capability gaps across models.",
  "method": [
    "Fine-tune an MLLM as an auditor using reinforcement learning to generate adversarial queries and counterfactual images that maximize disagreement among target models.",
    "Aggregate disagreement signals to identify, cluster, and prioritize distinct failure modes across models.",
    "Perform targeted rectification (e.g., focused fine-tuning, curated data augmentation, or prompt/policy updates) guided by the auditor's discoveries to close capability gaps."

  "impact": "Provides practitioners a practical, interpretable loop for finding and fixing model blind spots—improving robustness, guiding targeted dataset curation, and making model comparisons more actionable.",
