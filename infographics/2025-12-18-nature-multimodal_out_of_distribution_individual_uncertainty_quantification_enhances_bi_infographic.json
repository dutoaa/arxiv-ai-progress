  "key_insight": "eMOSAIC combines multimodal molecular and protein information with per-sample out-of-distribution (OOD) uncertainty estimates to substantially improve binding affinity prediction for compounds that act on multiple targets (polypharmacology). This lets models flag unreliable predictions and prioritize trustworthy candidate-target pairs.",
  "problem_solved": "Accurate binding affinity prediction for polypharmacology is hampered by multimodal inputs and out-of-distribution examples; the paper addresses unreliable predictions by providing individual uncertainty quantification to detect and mitigate OOD failures.",
  "method": [
    "Integrate multimodal representations (chemical features, protein descriptors/structures, and contextual assay metadata) into a unified prediction model.",
    "Produce calibrated, per-sample uncertainty estimates that identify OOD compound–protein pairs and adjust or reject low-confidence affinity predictions.",
    "Use uncertainty-aware decision rules to improve ranking and selection of polypharmacological candidates (reducing false positives and guiding experiments)."
  ],
  "impact": "Provides AI/ML practitioners a practical pipeline to make binding affinity models more reliable and actionable in drug discovery, enabling safer prioritization of multitarget compounds and reducing wasted experimental effort.",
