  "key_insight": "A multimodal deep learning model that jointly uses molecular sequence, 3D structure and biochemical properties can predict immunogenicity accurately while providing interpretable signals for hypothesis generation.",
  "problem_solved": "Current immunogenicity prediction methods often rely on single data modalities (sequence only) or produce black-box outputs; this work addresses the need for integrated, biologically grounded and interpretable immunogenicity forecasts.",

    "Integrate three input modalities — primary sequence, structural (3D) information and biochemical/physicochemical features — into a single predictive model.",
    "Use structure-aware encoders and multimodal fusion followed by an interpretable prediction head that provides residue- or region-level attribution for immunogenic drivers.",
    "Train and validate the model on experimental immunogenicity datasets to enable hypothesis generation and downstream design decisions."
