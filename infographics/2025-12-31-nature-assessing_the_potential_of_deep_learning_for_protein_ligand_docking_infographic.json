  "method": [
    "Constructed PoseBench: a curated, diverse dataset with labeled difficulty tiers and withheld test splits for fair evaluation.",
    "Evaluated multiple state-of-the-art deep-learning docking and structure-prediction methods using standardized metrics (RMSD, success rate, ranking/scoring) and compared to classical docking baselines.",
    "Performed systematic analyses of failure modes and case studies to identify factors (ligand flexibility, pocket dynamics, scoring) that degrade model performance."
