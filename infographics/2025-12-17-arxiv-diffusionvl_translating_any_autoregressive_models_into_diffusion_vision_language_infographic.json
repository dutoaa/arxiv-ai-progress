  "problem_solved": "Diffusion vision-language models lag behind mainstream AR-based VLMs because base diffusion language models lack comparable capabilities; this work addresses how to build competitive dVLMs by reusing powerful pretrained AR models instead of training new diffusion LMs from scratch.",
  "method": [
    "Introduce a translation/interface that maps pretrained AR model behavior into a diffusion-compatible component, allowing the AR backbone to be used inside a diffusion generation loop.",
    "Train lightweight adapters or distill from AR outputs into a diffusion score model so the system preserves AR knowledge while supporting diffusion denoising and conditional image-to-text/text-to-image workflows.",
    "Combine diffusion decoding advantages (e.g., flexible parallel generation, robustness) with AR model strengths via joint conditioning and inference strategies tailored for multimodal tasks."

  "impact": "Enables practitioners to rapidly build high-performing diffusion VLMs by repurposing existing AR models, unlocking diffusion decoding benefits (robustness, parallelism, flexible conditioning) without sacrificing language and multimodal capabilities.",
