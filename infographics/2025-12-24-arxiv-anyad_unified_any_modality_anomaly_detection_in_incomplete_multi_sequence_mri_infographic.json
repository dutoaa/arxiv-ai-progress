  "key_insight": "AnyAD learns a single, modality-agnostic anomaly detection model that reliably detects brain MRI anomalies from any subset of available sequences, removing the need to train separate models for each modality combination.",
  "problem_solved": "Clinical MRI workflows often miss one or more sequences and annotated abnormal cases are scarce; existing AD models assume fixed modality inputs or require repeated retraining and so fail to scale to arbitrary, incomplete multi-sequence inputs.",
  "method": [
    "Train a unified representation that accepts variable sets of MRI sequences by simulating missing modalities during training (modality dropout / masked inputs).",
    "Learn anomaly scoring in the shared latent space (e.g., reconstruction error or latent-density based) so scores are comparable across different input subsets.",
    "Deploy a single model that performs inference on any combination of available sequences without retraining, enabling robust AD in incomplete multi-sequence MRI."
  ],
  "impact": "Enables scalable, clinically practical MRI anomaly detection that tolerates missing sequences and reduces repeated model training; lowers deployment burden and improves robustness of ML systems in heterogeneous imaging environments.",
