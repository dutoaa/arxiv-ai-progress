  "key_insight": "DiffusionVL provides a practical recipe to turn strong autoregressive (AR) language models into diffusion-based vision–language models (dVLMs), closing the performance gap by leveraging AR capabilities within a diffusion decoding paradigm.",
  "problem_solved": "Bridges the capability gap where diffusion vision–language models underperform mainstream AR-based models by enabling reuse of powerful existing AR models in a diffusion framework.",
  "method": [
    "Introduce a translation pipeline that maps an AR model's outputs/conditioning into a diffusion-compatible latent space so the AR model can act as a teacher or backbone for a dVLM.",
    "Use targeted distillation and alignment objectives to transfer generation quality and multimodal grounding from the AR model to the diffusion decoder while preserving diffusion decoding benefits.",
    "Adopt modular adapters that connect vision encoders and AR-derived language modules to a diffusion denoiser, enabling plug-and-play conversion across different AR architectures."
