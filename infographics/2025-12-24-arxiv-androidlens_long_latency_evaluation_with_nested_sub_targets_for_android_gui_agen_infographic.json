  "key_insight": "AndroidLens provides a realistic, multilingual benchmark of long‑latency mobile GUI tasks with nested sub‑targets, exposing capabilities and failures of GUI agents on multi‑step workflows (avg. >26 steps).",
  "problem_solved": "Existing GUI agent evaluations are limited to few apps, short/simple tasks, and coarse metrics; AndroidLens fills the gap by offering a large, challenging suite that measures performance on realistic, long‑horizon, hierarchical tasks in Chinese and English.",
  "method": [
    "Curate 571 long‑latency tasks spanning common mobile apps, each decomposed into nested sub‑targets to capture hierarchical goals and dependencies.",
    "Provide multilingual (Chinese & English) task descriptions and structured step sequences to force multi‑step planning and execution (avg. >26 steps per task).",
    "Introduce finer‑grained evaluation metrics (e.g., sub‑target success, step‑level progress, latency/robustness) to reveal partial successes and systematic failure modes."
  ],
  "impact": "AndroidLens enables more realistic, diagnostic evaluation of mobile GUI agents, guiding development of planners, error‑recovery, and latency‑aware policies; researchers can now benchmark robustness on truly long‑horizon, hierarchical tasks.",
  "visual_elements": [
    "Hierarchical diagram showing a task decomposed into nested sub‑targets (root goal → subgoals → atomic steps).",
    "Sequential timeline/flowchart illustrating a representative 26+ step long‑latency task across multiple apps.",
    "Bar/line chart comparing AndroidLens vs prior benchmarks (num tasks, avg steps, languages, metric granularity).",
    "Icon collage of mobile apps + bilingual labels to emphasize multilingual, cross‑app coverage."
