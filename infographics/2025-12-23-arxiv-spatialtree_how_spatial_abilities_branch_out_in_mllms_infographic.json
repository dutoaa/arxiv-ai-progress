  "key_insight": "SpatialTree defines a four-level cognitive hierarchy (L1 perception → L2 mental mapping → L3 simulation → L4 agentic competence) and shows that spatial abilities in MLLMs are unevenly developed, branching from strong low-level perception to weaker higher-level simulation and agentic skills.",
  "problem_solved": "Addresses the lack of a principled, multi-level taxonomy and benchmark for evaluating the full range of spatial abilities in multimodal LLMs, moving beyond narrow task suites to reveal where models succeed or fail across a cognitive hierarchy.",
  "method": [
    "Propose SpatialTree: a cognitively inspired hierarchy of spatial abilities (L1–L4) with task exemplars for each level.",
    "Build the first comprehensive capability benchmark that maps MLLM performance to the SpatialTree levels across curated multimodal tasks.",
    "Evaluate multiple state-of-the-art MLLMs to generate a capability map, analyze failure modes, and identify gaps between perception and higher-level spatial reasoning/agency."

  "impact": "Gives researchers and engineers a clear framework and benchmark to diagnose, compare, and target improvements in spatial competence of MLLMs—guiding dataset design, training objectives, and model selection for spatially grounded applications.",
