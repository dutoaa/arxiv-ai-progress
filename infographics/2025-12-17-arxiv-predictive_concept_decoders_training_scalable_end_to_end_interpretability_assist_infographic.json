  "key_insight": "Train small, learned \"predictive concept decoders\" end-to-end to map internal activations to concept-like signals that predict a model's behavior, enabling scalable, more faithful interpretability than hand-designed hypothesis testers.",
  "problem_solved": "Interpreting complex neural activation spaces is hard and existing scalable approaches rely on hand-designed agents that don't generalize well or scale to many concepts/behaviors.",
  "method": [
    "Attach learned concept decoders to internal activations and train them end-to-end to predict downstream model behavior (outputs, decisions, or intermediate behaviors).",
    "Optimize decoders for predictive fidelity to the model rather than manual probe design, letting the system discover useful activation–concept mappings automatically.",
    "Use this predictive objective to scale interpretability assistants across many concepts, layers, and inputs while retaining faithful explanations."
  ],
  "impact": "Provides practitioners a scalable way to extract faithful, actionable explanations from model internals for debugging, monitoring, and alignment. Makes concept-level probes practical at production scale without extensive hand-engineering.",
