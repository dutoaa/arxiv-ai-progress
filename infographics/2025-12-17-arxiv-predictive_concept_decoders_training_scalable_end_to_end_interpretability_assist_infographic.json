  "key_insight": "Train small end-to-end “interpretability assistants” (Predictive Concept Decoders) to map internal activations to human-understandable concepts that accurately predict model behavior, replacing slow hand-designed hypothesis testing with scalable learned probes.",
  "problem_solved": "Internal activation spaces are high-dimensional and hard to interpret; existing scalable methods rely on manually designed agents and probes that don’t generalize or scale. This work makes internal explanations faithful and automatable by turning interpretability into a predictive learning objective.",
  "method": [
    "Learn concept decoders end-to-end that take model activations as input and output concept scores that predict the model’s downstream behavior or outputs.",
    "Optimize a fidelity/predictive objective so the decoders capture activation structure directly relevant to model decisions (not just correlational features).",
    "Use the trained assistants to generate, test, and visualize interpretable hypotheses at scale, enabling automated probing across layers, units, and tasks."

  "impact": "Provides a practical, scalable route to faithful internal explanations that practitioners can use for debugging, monitoring, and alignment work. Reduces reliance on hand-crafted probes and speeds up discovery of meaningful internal representations.",
