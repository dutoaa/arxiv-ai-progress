  "key_insight": "Dynamic Rebatching (DREX) reorganizes running inference work so tokens/requests that become ready to exit are regrouped into new batches, preserving early-exit benefits while keeping hardware-efficient batch processing.",
  "problem_solved": "Standard batching forces all requests to wait for the slowest item or forces premature exits, which either wastes compute or degrades output quality for Early-Exit LLMs.",
  "method": [
    "Continuously monitor per-token/request early-exit readiness as inference progresses through layers.",
    "Dynamically form homogeneous sub-batches of items that are ready to take an early exit and schedule them immediately, instead of waiting for the entire original batch.",
    "Use an adaptive scheduler/policy to balance latency, throughput, and quality (integrates with existing runtimes to maintain hardware utilization)."
  ],
  "impact": "Enables lower latency and higher effective throughput for early-exit LLMs without sacrificing output quality, making EE architectures more practical in production inference pipelines.",
