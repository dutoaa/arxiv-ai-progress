  "key_insight": "Skyra uses a multimodal LLM to detect AI-generated videos by identifying and reasoning about human-perceivable visual artifacts, producing both a detection decision and grounded, human-readable explanations.",
  "problem_solved": "Existing video detectors mostly give binary labels without localized, interpretable evidence; Skyra fills the gap by providing artifact-based, explainable detection that humans can inspect and verify.",
  "method": [
    "Train/fine-tune a multimodal large language model to recognize and name visual artifacts (e.g., temporal flicker, lip-sync errors, inconsistent textures) from frame sequences and short clips.",
    "Perform grounded artifact reasoning: localize artifacts in space/time, aggregate evidence across frames, and produce natural-language explanations that cite specific frames/regions as proof.",
    "Combine artifact taxonomy, temporal consistency checks, and confidence scoring to produce a final detection verdict along with interpretable, frame-level evidence."

  "impact": "Skyra enables more trustworthy, actionable AI-generated video detection for practitioners and forensic analysts by turning opaque binary decisions into verifiable, human-understandable evidence — improving auditability and intervention workflows.",
