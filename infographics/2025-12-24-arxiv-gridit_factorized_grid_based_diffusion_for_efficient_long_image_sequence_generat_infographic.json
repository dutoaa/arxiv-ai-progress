  "key_insight": "Instead of treating a long image sequence as one huge stacked tensor, GriDiT factorizes the sequence into a grid of smaller spatial-temporal blocks and runs diffusion over that grid—dramatically reducing computation and memory while preserving temporal coherence.",
  "problem_solved": "Current generative models for long image sequences become computationally and memory-inefficient when frames are naively stacked; GriDiT addresses scalability and bottlenecks in generating long, high-resolution image sequences.",
