  "key_insight": "Treating context management as an explicit, callable tool (CAT) for LLM-based software-engineering agents enables proactive, semantic-aware pruning and organization of context, preventing context explosion and preserving reasoning quality over long-horizon interactions.",
  "problem_solved": "Existing SWE agents use append-only context or passive compression heuristics that cause context explosion, semantic drift, and degraded reasoning during long-running interactions with large code repositories.",
  "method": [
    "Elevate context maintenance to a first-class tool with explicit operations (ingest, retrieve, summarize/compress, prune, and replace) that the agent can call during reasoning.",
    "Use repository-aware indexing and semantic relevance scoring to prioritize and retain high-value context while applying targeted summarization and provenance-aware compression to older material.",
    "Organize memory hierarchically (short-term working context + long-term archive) and apply policy-driven retention to avoid drift and maintain coherency across extended workflows."
  ],
  "impact": "Makes LLM-driven software agents more scalable and reliable for long-horizon engineering tasks across large codebases, reducing error rates and cognitive overload from oversized contexts while improving end-to-end task performance and latency.",
