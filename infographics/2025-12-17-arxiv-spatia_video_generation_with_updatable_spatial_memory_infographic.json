  "key_insight": "Spatia preserves a persistent 3D scene point-cloud as spatial memory and uses it to condition iterative clip generation, continuously updating that memory via visual SLAM to achieve much stronger long-term spatial and temporal consistency in generated video.",
  "problem_solved": "Existing video generation models fail to maintain consistent geometry, appearance, and object placement over long sequences because video is dense and high-dimensional; Spatia addresses this by explicitly storing and updating scene-level 3D memory.",
  "method": [
    "Maintain a persistent 3D point-cloud spatial memory representing scene geometry and appearance.",
    "Iteratively generate short video clips conditioned on the spatial memory with explicit dynamic–static disentanglement (separating moving objects from static scene).",
    "Continuously update the spatial memory using visual SLAM from produced/observed frames so future clips remain consistent with accumulated scene structure."
  ],
  "impact": "Provides a practical framework for generating longer, scene-consistent videos useful for simulation, content creation, and robotics; enables models to reason about persistent 3D structure rather than only frame-by-frame signals.",
