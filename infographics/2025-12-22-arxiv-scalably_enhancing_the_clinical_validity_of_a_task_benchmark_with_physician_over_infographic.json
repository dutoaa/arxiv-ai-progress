  "key_insight": "Integrating scalable physician oversight into an LLM-derived benchmark (MedCalc-Bench) prevents model errors from becoming entrenched as evaluation gold standards, improving the clinical validity of automated risk-score evaluation with minimal clinician time.",
  "problem_solved": "Model-generated clinical benchmarks can encode systematic LLM or rule-aggregation errors; without scalable human curation, these datasets mislead model evaluation and risk amplifying clinical mistakes.",
  "method": [
    "Hybrid pipeline: retain LLM-based feature extraction and rule-based aggregation but add targeted physician review to verify and correct high-impact outputs.",
    "Priority sampling: select cases for clinician review using model uncertainty, disagreement signals, and clinical importance to maximize validation efficiency.",
    "Iterative curation: record adjudications, update benchmark labels, and re-evaluate models to close the loop while tracking inter-rater agreement and audit trails."

  "impact": "Provides a practical way to make large AI evaluation benchmarks clinically trustworthy without full manual curation, improving model development, deployment safety, and downstream patient care.",
