  "key_insight": "ReaSeq enriches sequential recommender models by injecting world knowledge through a reasoning layer, turning brittle ID-only item representations into semantically informed embeddings and enabling capture of beyond-log user interests.",
  "problem_solved": "Addresses two industrial limitations: sparse, ID-based item representations that hurt interest modeling under data sparsity, and the inability to reason about user interests outside platform logs.",
  "method": [
    "Augment item IDs with external world knowledge (product semantics, attributes, text) to create richer representations.",
    "Apply a reasoning module that propagates and refines knowledge along user interaction sequences to reveal latent interests beyond logs.",
    "Train the sequential model with objectives that align sequence prediction and knowledge-consistency to improve robustness under sparsity."
  ],
  "impact": "Provides a practical path for recommender systems to become more robust to cold-start and limited logs by leveraging external knowledge; practitioners can boost sequence modeling performance and capture cross-platform or latent interests without relying solely on interaction counts.",
