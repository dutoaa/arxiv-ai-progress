  "key_insight": "AndroidLens introduces a large-scale, bilingual benchmark of long-latency Android GUI tasks annotated with nested sub-targets, enabling fine-grained, stepwise evaluation of mobile GUI agents. This reveals agent performance on realistic multi-step workflows rather than coarse end-to-end success alone.",
  "problem_solved": "Existing GUI-agent benchmarks are limited to few apps, short/simple tasks, and coarse-grained metrics, which fail to measure agent capability on realistic long, multi-step mobile workflows and subgoal recovery.",
  "method": [
    "Curate 571 long-latency tasks across Chinese and English environments, each averaging >26 steps to reflect realistic mobile workflows.",
    "Annotate tasks with nested sub-targets to enable hierarchical, stepwise evaluation (subgoal success, intermediate recovery, end-to-end completion).",
    "Provide a benchmarking protocol and fine-grained metrics (e.g., sub-target success rates, latency, error propagation) to evaluate robustness over long action sequences."

  "impact": "AndroidLens gives researchers and practitioners a realistic, granular way to measure and improve GUI agents for complex mobile tasks, guiding progress on long-horizon planning, error recovery, and cross-lingual interface handling.",
