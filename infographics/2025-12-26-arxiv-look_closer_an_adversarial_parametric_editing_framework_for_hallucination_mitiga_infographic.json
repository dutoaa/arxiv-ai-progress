  "key_insight": "Introduce a trainable, adversarial parametric editor that 'looks closer' at visual features and edits VLM behavior to reduce hallucinations by weakening harmful linguistic priors and strengthening visual grounding.",
  "problem_solved": "VLMs often hallucinate—producing text not supported by the image—because they over-rely on language priors and insufficiently integrate visual evidence. This paper addresses the lack of a trainable, controllable mechanism to correct those misalignments without breaking model capabilities.",
  "method": [
    "Adversarial parametric editor: a small trainable module that applies targeted edits to the VLM’s internal representations to counteract hallucination-inducing signals.",
    "Adversarial training objective: generate challenging visual–text pairs and optimize the editor to reduce hallucinated outputs while enforcing fidelity to true visual evidence.",
    "Constrained editing and regularization: preserve original model skills by limiting edit magnitude and using losses that balance hallucination reduction with performance retention."

  "impact": "Provides a practical, trainable tool to make VLM outputs more visually faithful and reliable, enabling safer and more accurate multimodal deployment without retraining entire models.",
