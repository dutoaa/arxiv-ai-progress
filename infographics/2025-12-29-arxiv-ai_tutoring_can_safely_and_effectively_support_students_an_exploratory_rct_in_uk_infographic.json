  "key_insight": "An exploratory randomized controlled trial (N = 165 across five UK secondary schools) indicates that a pedagogy-finetuned generative model (LearnLM) integrated into chat-based math tutoring can safely and effectively support students in classroom settings.",
  "problem_solved": "One-to-one tutoring is highly effective but prohibitively expensive to scale; this work tests whether generative AI can expand access to personalized tutoring without compromising student safety or learning quality.",
  "method": [
    "Deployed LearnLM (a generative model fine-tuned for pedagogy) within chat-based tutoring on the Eedi mathematics platform",
    "Conducted an exploratory randomized controlled trial with 165 students across five UK secondary schools to evaluate learning outcomes and safety",
    "Monitored safety and pedagogical quality through expert oversight, predefined safety checks, and classroom-integrated usage"
