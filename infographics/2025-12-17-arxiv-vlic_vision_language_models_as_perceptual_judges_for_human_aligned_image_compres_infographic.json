  "method": [
    "Use a state-of-the-art vision-language model to compare original vs. compressed images and produce a perceptual score or binary preference prediction.",
    "Calibrate or fine-tune VLM outputs against a small set of human binary judgments so the model’s scores align with human choices.",
    "Use the VLM-derived score as an evaluation metric or as a surrogate loss to train or select compression models that better match human preferences."
