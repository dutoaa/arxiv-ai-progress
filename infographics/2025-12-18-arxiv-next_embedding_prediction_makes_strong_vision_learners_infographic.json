    "Formulate pretraining as predicting the embedding of future image patches conditioned on past patches using causal masking (autoregressive over patch embeddings).",
    "Use a stable target embedding stream (e.g., stop-gradient / momentum target encoder) so the model learns to generate embeddings rather than collapse to trivial solutions.",
    "Train a transformer-style model to minimize prediction loss in embedding space and transfer the learned model (or its encoder) to downstream tasks."
