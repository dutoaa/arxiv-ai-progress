  "key_insight": "AuditDM trains an MLLM as an automated auditor (via reinforcement learning) that generates challenging questions and counterfactual images to maximally expose differences between models, then uses those divergences to guide targeted fixes.",
  "problem_solved": "Conventional evaluation of multimodal LLMs is often opaque and misses important capability gaps; AuditDM actively discovers interpretable failure modes by forcing models to disagree so practitioners can diagnose and fix them.",
  "method": [
    "Fine-tune an MLLM as an auditor with reinforcement learning to generate hard prompts and counterfactual images that aim to maximize disagreement among target models.",
    "Measure and cluster inter-model divergences to surface distinct failure modes and produce interpretable examples that highlight where models differ.",
    "Use discovered disagreements to drive rectification (e.g., targeted data augmentation or model fine-tuning) that closes capability gaps."

  "impact": "Provides a scalable, interpretable way to audit and improve multimodal models—enabling targeted debugging, safer deployment, and more robust model comparison beyond scalar benchmarks.",
