  "key_insight": "WorldCanvas enables promptable, controllable world-event generation by jointly conditioning on text, trajectories (motion/timing/visibility), and reference images, bridging semantic intent with precise spatio-temporal control and visual identity. This multimodal fusion produces coherent, user-directed simulations that go beyond text-only or trajectory-only image-to-video methods.",
  "problem_solved": "Existing approaches either rely on text alone (lacking precise motion/timing) or on trajectories without semantic/visual grounding. WorldCanvas addresses the challenge of producing coherent, controllable event simulations that honor user intent, object identity, and explicit motion/visibility constraints.",
  "method": [
    "Multimodal conditioning: combine natural language for semantic intent, trajectories encoding motion/timing/visibility, and reference images for visual grounding of object identity.",
    "Fuse modalities into a generative simulation pipeline to produce temporally coherent event sequences (image/video) that follow specified trajectories and textual prompts.",
    "Design interfaces/representations that let users specify high-level goals (text) and low-level spatial/temporal constraints (trajectories + reference visuals) for deterministic, controllable outputs."
  ],
  "impact": "This approach gives practitioners fine-grained control over generated events while preserving semantic meaning and visual fidelity, enabling applications in animation, virtual prototyping, interactive storytelling, and realistic simulation. It reduces ambiguity in generation and improves reproducibility of desired behaviors.",
  "visual_elements": [
    "Modality-fusion diagram: three inputs (text, trajectory timeline, reference image) converging into a generative model producing an output video/frame sequence.",
    "Trajectory overlay timeline: sample frames with paths/arrows showing motion, timing markers, and visibility toggles to illustrate control granularity.",
    "Before/after examples: same text prompt with and without reference images or trajectories to show differences in identity and motion fidelity.",
    "User-interface mockup: simple prompt panel combining text, drawable trajectories, and image upload to demonstrate usability."
