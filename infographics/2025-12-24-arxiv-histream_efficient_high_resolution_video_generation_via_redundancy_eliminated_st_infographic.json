  "method": [
    "Spatial compression: perform denoising at lower resolution then refine to high resolution using cached high‑level features to avoid re-computing shared spatial detail.",
    "Temporal compression: generate video in streaming chunks with overlap and temporal feature caching so adjacent frames reuse computation rather than reprocessing entire sequences.",
    "Sampling/computation compression: concentrate expensive high‑res denoising only where needed and reuse denoising trajectories or intermediate features to cut the number of heavy diffusion operations."

  "impact": "Enables faster, lower‑cost high‑resolution video synthesis on practical hardware and makes large-scale or real‑time applications of diffusion-based video models more attainable for ML practitioners.",
