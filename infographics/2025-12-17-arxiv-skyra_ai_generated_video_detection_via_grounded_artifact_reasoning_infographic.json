  "key_insight": "Skyra is a multimodal large language model that detects AI-generated videos by spotting human-perceivable visual artifacts and uses those artifacts as grounded, human-readable evidence rather than only producing a binary label.",
  "problem_solved": "Existing AI-generated video detectors give binary outputs with little interpretability; Skyra addresses the need for reliable detection plus grounded explanations that humans and practitioners can inspect and trust.",
  "method": [
    "Train a specialized MLLM to recognize and name visual artifacts (e.g., temporal flicker, inconsistent shadows, texture glitches) across video frames and localize them spatially and temporally.",
    "Aggregate artifact detections into grounded evidence and perform reasoning to produce a detection decision accompanied by human-readable explanations and visual highlights.",
    "Leverage multimodal inputs (frame sequences, optical-flow or temporal features, and auxiliary metadata) and curated annotations to align model outputs with human-perceivable artifacts."
  ],
  "impact": "Skyra improves trust and usability of video forensics by giving practitioners actionable, interpretable evidence—enabling better triage, human review, and downstream policy or legal actions instead of opaque automated flags.",
