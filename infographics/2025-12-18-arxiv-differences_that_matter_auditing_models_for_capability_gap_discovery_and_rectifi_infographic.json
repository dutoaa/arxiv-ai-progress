  "key_insight": "AuditDM trains an MLLM as an automated auditor (via reinforcement learning) to generate questions and counterfactual images that intentionally maximize disagreement across models, revealing actionable capability gaps and enabling targeted fixes.",
  "problem_solved": "Conventional evaluations for multimodal LLMs are often opaque and miss important, model-specific failure modes; AuditDM systematically discovers and helps rectify those hidden capability gaps.",
  "method": [
    "Fine-tune an MLLM as an auditor using reinforcement learning with an objective to maximize divergence among a set of target models.",
    "Automatically generate challenging queries and counterfactual images that expose disagreement-driven failure modes.",
    "Use the discovered disagreements to create targeted interventions (e.g., focused data augmentation or targeted fine-tuning) to rectify model weaknesses."
