  "key_insight": "Combines specialized agents that analyze image, text, and contextual cues to detect depressive symptoms in memes, supported by a new dataset (RESTOREx) and collaborative reasoning. The multi-aspect, multi-agent design yields more nuanced symptom identification than single-stream models.",
  "problem_solved": "Automates identification of depressive symptoms expressed in multimodal memes—a challenging task due to subtle humor, sarcasm, and the need to jointly interpret visual and textual cues.",
  "method": [
    "Multi-Aspect Multi-Agent (MAMA) architecture: separate agents specialize in image, text, and contextual/social signals and communicate for joint inference.",
    "Collaborative fusion and consensus: agents share evidence and reasoning (e.g., via a mediator or LLM) to produce symptom-level labels instead of single binary outputs.",
    "Introduced RESTOREx: a curated multimodal dataset and annotation schema for depressive symptoms used to train and evaluate the model."

  "impact": "Provides a practical multimodal modeling pattern and dataset for researchers building sensitive, fine-grained mental-health detection systems from social media content, improving interpretability and robustness over single-modality approaches.",
