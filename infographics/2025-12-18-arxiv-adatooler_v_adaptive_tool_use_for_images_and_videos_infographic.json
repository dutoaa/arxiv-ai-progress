  "key_insight": "AdaTooler-V enables multimodal LLMs to decide when to call vision tools for images and videos, avoiding unnecessary tool invocations to cut inference overhead and improve end-task performance.",
  "problem_solved": "Open-source MLLMs often exhibit blind tool-use—invoking vision tools even when not needed—leading to higher latency, compute cost, and degraded performance; this paper solves adaptive, necessity-aware tool invocation for visual tasks.",
  "method": [
    "A lightweight decision/gating module that predicts whether a given visual query requires external vision-tool access (images or video frames).",
    "Interleaved multimodal chain-of-thought with conditional tool invocation: the model uses internal multimodal reasoning by default and calls vision tools only when the gate indicates utility.",
    "Cost-aware training/objective that balances task accuracy and tool-usage overhead, evaluated across image and video benchmarks to demonstrate reduced calls and maintained or improved accuracy."

  "impact": "Makes multimodal LLMs more computationally efficient and practically deployable for image/video tasks by reducing unnecessary tool calls, lowering latency and cost while preserving or enhancing task performance.",
