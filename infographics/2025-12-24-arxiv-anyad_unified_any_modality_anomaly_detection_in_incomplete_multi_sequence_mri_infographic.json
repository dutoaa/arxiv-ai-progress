  "key_insight": "AnyAD is a single unified model that detects anomalies from brain MRI even when one or more common sequences are missing — it generalizes to arbitrary combinations of modalities without retraining.",
  "problem_solved": "Overcomes the clinical reality of incomplete multi-sequence MRI and the limitation of prior AD models that require fixed modality configurations or repeated training for different modality sets.",
  "method": [
    "Train a unified any-modality architecture that ingests any subset of MRI sequences and maps them to a shared latent space for anomaly scoring.",
    "Simulate missing-modality conditions during training (modality dropout / conditional masking) so the model learns to fuse available inputs robustly and to impute or ignore absent channels.",
    "Produce uncertainty-aware anomaly maps via reconstruction / distributional scoring in the shared latent space, enabling single-model deployment across unseen modality combinations."

  "impact": "Enables practical, scalable deployment of MRI anomaly detection across heterogeneous clinical protocols, reducing the need for modality-specific models and repeated retraining while maintaining robust detection under missing data.",

    "Schematic: inputs with varying MRI sequences (T1, T2, FLAIR, etc.) feeding a single AnyAD model and producing an anomaly map — demonstrates 'any-modality' flow.",

    "Performance chart: accuracy/ROC or anomaly-score robustness across many modality-combination scenarios comparing AnyAD vs fixed-config baselines.",
    "Example overlays: MRI slices with ground-truth (if available) and AnyAD anomaly heatmaps to show localization quality."
