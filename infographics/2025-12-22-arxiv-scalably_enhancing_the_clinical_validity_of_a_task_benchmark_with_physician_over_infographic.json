  "key_insight": "Adding scalable physician oversight to an LLM‑generated clinical benchmark corrects systematic model errors and substantially improves the benchmark's clinical validity without requiring full manual reannotation.",
  "problem_solved": "Addresses the risk of LLM‑produced evaluation datasets becoming entrenched as flawed gold standards by providing a practical, scalable way to audit and correct clinical feature extraction and aggregation errors.",
  "method": [
    "Physician‑in‑the‑loop verification targeted to high‑risk or high‑uncertainty cases (sample + model‑flagging) rather than full dataset relabeling.",
    "Edit‑and‑verify workflow: present extracted features and aggregated risk scores to clinicians for rapid correction, track provenance and consensus, and integrate fixes back into the benchmark.",
    "Automated triage using model uncertainty/disagreement and lightweight heuristics to prioritize cases that most impact clinical validity and evaluation metrics."
  ],
  "impact": "Makes clinical benchmark evaluation more trustworthy for AI/ML work in healthcare, reducing the chance of training or evaluating models against flawed labels and enabling safer deployment and more reliable comparisons.",
