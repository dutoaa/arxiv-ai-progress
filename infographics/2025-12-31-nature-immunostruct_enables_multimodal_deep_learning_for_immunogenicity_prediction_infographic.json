  "problem_solved": "Accurate immunogenicity prediction is difficult because determinants span sequence, structure and physicochemistry and existing models are often single‑modal and non‑interpretable; this work solves multimodal integration with explanations that highlight drivers of immune response.",
  "method": [
    "Multimodal architecture that encodes sequence (learned embeddings), 3D structural context (graph/structure-aware embeddings) and handcrafted biochemical features, then fuses them into a joint representation.",
    "Built‑in interpretability (attention and feature‑attribution) maps predictions back to residues and structural regions to support hypothesis generation.",
    "Trained and benchmarked on curated immunogenicity datasets, showing improved predictive performance versus single‑modality baselines and demonstrated use cases for molecular design."

  "impact": "Provides a reproducible blueprint for combining heterogeneous biological data in predictive models while preserving interpretability, accelerating AI‑driven protein and vaccine design. The approach is broadly applicable to other biomolecular property prediction tasks.",
