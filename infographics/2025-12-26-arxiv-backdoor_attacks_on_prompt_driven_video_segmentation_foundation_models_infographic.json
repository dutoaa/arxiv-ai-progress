  "key_insight": "Classic backdoor attacks (e.g., BadNet) transfer poorly to prompt-driven video segmentation foundation models like SAM2 (attack success rate < 5%), and analysis of encoder gradients and attention maps explains why triggers fail to produce consistent malicious behavior.",
  "problem_solved": "Assesses whether conventional image/video backdoor techniques can compromise prompt-driven video segmentation foundation models and diagnoses why straightforward transfer attacks are ineffective.",
  "method": [
    "Empirically apply standard backdoor attacks (BadNet-style) to prompt-driven VSFMs and measure attack success rates (ASR).",
    "Analyze internal signals—encoder gradient norms and attention maps—for clean vs. triggered samples to identify why triggers do not induce target behaviors.",
    "Run controlled diagnostic/ablation experiments to isolate model components and mechanisms that block trigger-conditioned changes."
  ],
  "impact": "Reveals that prompt-driven VSFMs exhibit inherent resistance to naive backdoor transfers, so security evaluations and defenses must be redesigned for prompt-based segmentation systems; attackers and defenders should adopt new threat models and tailored tests.",
