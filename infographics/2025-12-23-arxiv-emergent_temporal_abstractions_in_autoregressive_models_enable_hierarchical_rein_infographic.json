  "key_insight": "Pretrained autoregressive models spontaneously form temporally extended latent patterns that can be treated as higher‑level actions, enabling a hierarchical RL controller to operate over macro‑steps instead of token-by-token sampling and dramatically improve exploration and learning efficiency.",
  "problem_solved": "Token-by-token action generation in autoregressive models makes exploration and credit assignment inefficient, especially in sparse‑reward, long‑horizon tasks. The paper solves how to extract and act over emergent temporal abstractions from the model's internal representations to enable hierarchical decision making.",
  "method": [
    "Analyze internal activations of pretrained autoregressive models to identify temporally coherent latent segments (emergent macro‑actions).",
    "Build a hierarchical RL setup where a high‑level policy selects latent segments or triggers and a low‑level decoder executes token sequences conditioned on that latent choice; finetune the high‑level policy with RL.",
    "Evaluate against token‑level baselines on sparse‑reward / long‑horizon tasks to demonstrate improved sample efficiency and faster learning."
