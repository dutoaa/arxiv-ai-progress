  "method": [
    "Resampling Forcing: replace external teachers/discriminators with a self-resampling scheme that intermittently feeds model-generated partial trajectories back into the training loop so the model learns to recover from its own samples.",
    "Align training and sampling distributions by simulating autoregressive sampling during training (resample frames/latents at various timesteps) and apply a forcing objective to robustify future-frame predictions.",
    "Design the pipeline to train from scratch at scale in an end-to-end fashion, removing dependence on bidirectional teacher models or online discriminators."
