  "key_insight": "What looks like a reasoning failure on abstract benchmarks (ARC, ARC-AGI) is largely a perception failure — a \"perception bottleneck\". When perceptual input is cleaned or replaced by symbolic representations, model reasoning performance improves substantially.",
  "problem_solved": "Reveals that standard abstract-reasoning benchmarks conflate perceptual decoding and high-level reasoning, causing misattribution of failures to reasoning when they often stem from perception; provides a methodology to disentangle and properly evaluate the two.",

    "Systematic error analysis of state-of-the-art vision–language models on ARC/ARC-AGI to classify failures as perceptual vs reasoning.",
    "Controlled experiments that supply models with ground-truth or cleaned symbolic encodings (bypassing perception) and compare results to raw-image inputs.",
    "Propose diagnostic evaluation protocols / dataset splits that isolate perceptual difficulty from core reasoning tasks so progress can be measured more precisely."
  ],
  "impact": "For researchers and practitioners, this reframes where effort should be invested — improving perception/representation and designing disentangled benchmarks yields more meaningful measures of reasoning progress. It guides architecture and evaluation choices so that claimed reasoning advances are not artifacts of easier perception.",
