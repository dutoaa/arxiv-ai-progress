  "problem_solved": "Accurate prediction of compound–protein binding across many targets is hampered by distribution shifts and unreliable point estimates; the paper addresses how to detect OOD cases and provide calibrated, individual uncertainties so predictions can be trusted and prioritized.",
  "method": [
    "Multimodal representation: jointly encode compound (e.g., graph/SMILES) and protein (sequence/structure) features to capture interaction mechanics.",
    "OOD-aware uncertainty quantification: identify out-of-distribution examples and produce per-sample (individual) uncertainty scores rather than global variance estimates.",
    "Integration for decision-making: use uncertainty to weigh or abstain from predictions, improving downstream hit prioritization in polypharmacology scenarios."
