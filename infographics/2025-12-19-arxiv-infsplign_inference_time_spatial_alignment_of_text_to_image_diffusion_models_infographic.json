  "key_insight": "InfSplign is a training-free, inference-time technique that improves how text-to-image diffusion models respect spatial relations by iteratively adjusting the denoising noise using a compound loss applied at every step.",
  "problem_solved": "Text-to-image diffusion models often ignore or misplace spatial relations described in prompts because training data lacks fine-grained spatial supervision and text embeddings do not reliably encode spatial semantics.",
  "method": [
    "Inference-time, training-free algorithm that intervenes during the denoising loop of pretrained diffusion models.",
    "At each denoising step, compute a compound loss that balances spatial alignment objectives with fidelity/prompt-consistency terms and backpropagate to adjust the noise input.",
    "Plug-and-play: compatible with existing T2I models and prompts, requiring no model fine-tuning or additional supervised data."
  ],
  "impact": "Enables practitioners to get more spatially accurate generations (better placement, relations, and layouts) without retraining models, improving reliability for design, UI mockups, and scene-composition applications.",
