  "key_insight": "Skyra is a multimodal large language model that detects human-perceivable visual artifacts in AI-generated videos and produces grounded, human-readable evidence instead of only a binary real/fake label.",
  "problem_solved": "Existing AI-generated video detectors focus on binary classification and lack explainability, making them hard for humans to trust or act on. Skyra fills this gap by localizing artifacts in space and time and providing interpretable artifact-level reasoning as evidence.",
  "method": [
    "Specialized MLLM ingests video frames (and optionally audio/metadata) to reason across visual and temporal cues.",
    "Automatic artifact identification: model outputs artifact types/locations (e.g., inconsistent lighting, warped geometry, temporal jitter) with spatio-temporal grounding.",
    "Generates natural-language explanations and visual overlays (heatmaps/bboxes/timestamped cues) as human-interpretable evidence for each detection."
  ],
  "impact": "Skyra improves trust and utility of AI-generated video detection by turning opaque binary decisions into actionable, explainable evidence for forensic analysts and practitioners. This enables better human–AI collaboration for moderation, audit, and legal workflows.",
