  "key_insight": "FrontierCS introduces a curated benchmark of 156 open-ended computer-science problems where optimal solutions are unknown but solution quality can be objectively evaluated, forcing models to generate executable programs and reason beyond fixed-answer tasks.",
  "problem_solved": "Existing benchmarks emphasize tasks with known optimal answers and limited creativity; FrontierCS fills the gap by providing expert-designed, open-ended challenges that evaluate a model's ability to design, implement, and empirically validate solutions.",
  "method": [
    "Curate 156 diverse, open-ended problems across CS subfields (algorithms, systems, ML, security, etc.) designed and reviewed by CS PhDs and top competitive programmers.",
    "Require models to produce executable programs or artifacts; evaluate submissions with objective, empirical metrics (correctness, performance, resource usage, robustness).",
    "Use expert review and standardized scoring pipelines to compare models on exploratory problem-solving, iterative improvement, and engineering trade-offs."
  ],
  "impact": "Provides a rigorous testbed for measuring and accelerating model capabilities in program synthesis, algorithm design, and empirical evaluation—pushing research toward more creative, engineering-oriented AI systems that can tackle real-world, open-ended problems.",
