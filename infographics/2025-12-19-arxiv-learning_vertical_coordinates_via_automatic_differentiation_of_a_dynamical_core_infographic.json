  "key_insight": "Terrain-following vertical coordinates can be made learnable and optimized end-to-end by differentiating through the atmospheric dynamical core, letting the model discover coordinate shapes that reduce grid-imprinted spurious motions instead of relying on fixed, hand-tuned decay scales.",
  "problem_solved": "Conventional terrain-following coordinates (hybrid, SLEVE, etc.) use analytic decay functions with heuristic scale parameters that are tuned by hand and can imprint distorted grid layers onto the solution, producing spurious horizontal and vertical motion over steep topography. The paper addresses automated discovery of coordinate definitions that minimize these errors.",
  "method": [
    "Define a parametric family of vertical coordinate transforms (e.g., parameterized decay functions or spatially-varying scale maps) with learnable parameters.",
    "Make the dynamical core differentiable and compute gradients of a chosen objective (e.g., metrics of spurious motion or forecast error) with respect to the coordinate parameters via automatic differentiation.",
    "Optimize parameters end-to-end with regularization and physical constraints so learned coordinates reduce grid imprinting while preserving stability and conservation properties."
