  "key_insight": "The paper introduces an end-to-end pipeline that converts a patient’s bulk RNA-seq profile into personalized small-molecule candidates by combining transcriptome-derived target selection with metaheuristic-driven de novo molecule assembly and target-aware filtering. This yields tailored drug leads for AML subtypes without relying solely on known mutations.",
  "problem_solved": "Addresses the lack of personalized therapeutic options for molecularly heterogeneous AML patients by linking individual transcriptomic signatures to de novo drug design workflows that prioritize patient-specific targets and multi-objective drug-like properties.",
  "method": [
    "Patient-specific transcriptomics (TCGA-LAML) → network and differential expression analysis to nominate personalized actionable targets (e.g., WGCNA / driver gene prioritization).",
    "Metaheuristic assembly (e.g., genetic algorithms / simulated annealing-guided fragment/SMILES assembly) to generate candidate small molecules conditioned on selected targets and structural constraints.",
    "Target-driven in silico filtering: docking / target affinity prediction, multi-objective scoring for potency, selectivity, ADMET and synthetic feasibility to prioritize personalized leads."
