  "key_insight": "Integrating autonomous uncertainty quantification with neural diagnostic models for point-of-care sensors enables the system to detect and flag low-confidence predictions in real time, reducing the risk of misdiagnosis and inappropriate automated outputs.",
  "problem_solved": "Neural-network-based computational POC sensors can produce hallucinations or erroneous outputs without a reliable measure of confidence, creating safety and trust issues when deployed in emergency, remote, or resource-limited settings.",
  "method": [
    "Embed lightweight, on-device uncertainty estimators alongside the diagnostic model to produce per-sample confidence scores (e.g., Bayesian approximations, ensembles, or evidential approaches tailored for edge constraints).",
    "Apply calibration and out-of-distribution detection so predicted probabilities match real-world accuracy and unknown inputs are flagged.",
    "Use autonomous decision logic that triggers abstention, prompts for human review, or routes results for higher-fidelity testing when uncertainty exceeds configured thresholds."

  "impact": "Provides a practical path for safer, trustworthy POC AI deployments by enabling real-time reliability estimates, improving triage and clinician trust, and supporting regulatory and operational requirements for medical AI at the edge.",
